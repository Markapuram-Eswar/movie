            "review": "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich\u00e9s and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."

Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox."

Probably no, not because the movie was bad or anything, it was absolutely flawless, but because it's always hard to point out one thing as the best ever, especially when you have so many other great works to accompany it. And, in addition, opinions are always subjective. But despite all of that, It was an incredible film, a timeless masterpiece which I feel safe to call one of the best that I have ever seen. It aspires for all the great things, and executes them perfectly. It is a movie that manages to make you see prison inmates, killers, rapists, and other outcasts of society, as complex human beings with feelings, dreams and hopes. It makes you relate to them in certain ways and empathize with them. It is a movie about never losing hope, despite what situation you end up in. To keep fighting for that freedom, that peace, which seems so far-fetched, but that you know you can achieve through perseverance. A true masterpiece."

And one of the victims child asked why did it take so long and there was supposedly some cops involved in the 33 crimes. So I started to think about the shawshank redemption and **** the shawshank redemption showing us that they did fake executions? You know movies reveal alot of things. Well you all ask what do I mean. Well the part when they were practicing the execution and they had the inmate acting like he was getting electrocuted. Well for one why wpuld they do that? With a inmate anyways. Why didnt they just do it with another officer? I believe they actually did stuff like that to fake executions on sime people. Because you know they put people out there to do things like this. I mean murder people and stuff. This is an evil world. How hard wpuld it be to fake an execution really? And they never let the public see ****? Someone with a depth of intellect please dialogue with me on this. Thanks I apologize I didnt mean shawshank redemption wrong movie! The Green Mile! Sorry!!!

Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."

The violence was insane, the plot was very big but intriguing, the cast gave terrific performances, especially actors who looked a lot different than I usually see them as in the 2000s (Robert DuVall and James Caan). They say it's one of the greatest films of all time. No kidding. It was made in the early 70s, and might have been the earliest to show incredible violence to back up the plot, that I can understand very well. I don't watch a lot of dark dramas, but this is one that is very legendary that even if you're not a fan of these types of films you should still watch it."

The episodic story is mostly quiet and deliberately paced, punctuated effectively with sudden violence. The cast is excellent, except for James Caan, who simply can't act (his Italian American shtick is almost minstrel-show level) and horrifies us with his gross shoulder and back hair.\n\nFor all its excellence, the movie pioneered some less-than-welcome trends Coppola and his generation would bring to movie making:\n\n1. The absence of interesting female characters. As in JAWS, EASY RIDER, BUTCH CASSIDY, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC, etc. women barely exist in these stories.\n\n2. Capitalism = gangsterism. Organized crime and regular businesses are portrayed as basically the same. Senators, judges, and governors are no different than violent thugs. The \"American dream\" is a pretty name for racism and oppression. Baby boomers picked up these foolish ideas from their 1930s socialist college professors and they've been a Hollywood clich\u00e9 ever since. The fact that so many Hollywood honchos ARE corrupt endlessly feeds filmmakers' silly implication that all businessmen are thugs.\n\n3. Boomer cynicism. Baby boomers emerged flinging contempt in all directions, believing themselves to be the first generation in human history to properly recognize and judge immorality. This tendency gave birth to the harsh, unforgiving hate and bullying of \"cancel culture\" today and -- so much for its moral virtue -- gave license to several generations to lie, cheat and steal because the movies show us that EVERYONE does. (Only everyone doesn't.)\n\nSo yes, THE GODFATHER is iconic, a massive hit, very influential and well crafted on every level. But it also embodied and popularized some regrettable trends in film and pop culture."

                    "review": "The Godfather, hailed by many as a masterpiece and even the \"greatest film ever made\", serves as a glaring exemplification of the broad chasm between popular perception and the harsh realities of cinematic mediocrity. Oversaturated with lengthy, dialogue-ridden sequences and an excess of poorly executed symbolism, Francis Ford Coppola's alleged magnum opus falls tragically short of its revered status.\n\nFrom the very first frames, the Godfather immerses the viewer in a relentless drudgery that will numb even the most patient film connoisseur. Instead of engaging audiences with brisk storytelling and gripping action, Coppola elects to drag us through a languorous three-hour mafia epic. You may find yourself regularly checking your watch, wondering when the end credits will arrive.\n\nThe characters, hailed by many as intricate and well-developed, are instead an ensemble of monotonous archetypes, masquerading as complex individuals. Marlon Brando\u2019s Vito Corleone, while celebrated for his mumbling and inaudible diction, offers little more than a tired caricature of a mob boss, while Al Pacino\u2019s Michael Corleone lacks a compelling arc, transforming from a moral outsider to a cold-hearted don in the blink of an eye, leaving little room for nuance or relatability.\n\nCoppola's direction is equally as lackluster. His use of low-lighting scenes, supposedly to add depth and mystery, merely blurs detail and confuses the viewer. What critics mistake for \"stylistic choices,\" come across as glaring technical ineptitude. The acclaimed Godfather Waltz, a repetitive, mournful piece of orchestral music, only adds to the already heavy-handed tone, doing little to alleviate the film's overall tedium.\n\nThe Godfather\u2019s narrative, loosely strung together by a series of underwhelming mob hits and family squabbles, often wanders into the realm of pointlessness. Instead of serving as a poignant critique of the American dream, it drowns in its own grandeur, ultimately amounting to little more than a caricature of the very thing it sought to depict.\n\nIn the end, The Godfather feels more like a long-winded bore, a film that not only overpromises and underdelivers, but audaciously demands respect and reverence for its contribution to cinema. It\u2019s a languid, overly-indulgent piece that relies on the audience's patience and tolerance for dull, drawn-out sequences. Despite its universal acclaim, The Godfather stands as a testament to how the sheen of nostalgia and the weight of collective opinion can crown a painfully average film as the pinnacle of cinematic excellence. It is a troublingly clear example of just how misguided the concept of the 'popular masterpiece' can be."

The story is dull and unengaging, with characters that are impossible to connect with or care about. The pacing is slow and plodding, making the film feel like it's dragging on forever.\n\nThe acting is also subpar, with actors delivering their lines with all the emotion of a brick wall. The dialogue is clunky and uninspired, with no memorable or quotable lines to speak of. The film also lacks any real sense of tension or excitement, making it a chore to sit through.\n\nThe cinematography is nothing special, with bland and forgettable shots that do nothing to add to the film's atmosphere. The soundtrack is also unremarkable, with forgettable music that fails to enhance the movie in any meaningful way.\n\nOverall, The Godfather is a film that's more hype than substance. It's a boring, forgettable movie that fails to live up to its reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Save yourself the time and watch something else instead."

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"

Christopher Nolan, the maestro behind the lens, orchestrated a symphony of darkness and complexity, transcending the simplistic narratives that often plague the comic book realm.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, an anarchic force of chaos, was nothing short of transcendental. Ledger didn't just act; he embodied the very essence of insanity, leaving an indelible mark on cinematic history. His performance was a chiaroscuro dance, a descent into madness that was both terrifying and **** film's moral quandaries, explored through Christian Bale's brooding Batman and Aaron Eckhart's tragic Two-Face, added layers of philosophical depth. It was a bleak exploration of the thin line between heroism and villainy, a narrative tightrope walk that few dared to ****, let's talk about Hans Zimmer's haunting score \u2013 a sonic landscape that elevated tension to an art form. The pulsating beats mirrored the erratic heartbeat of Gotham itself, and the Joker's eerie theme became the anthem of ****, my dear cinephile, don't let the accolades blind you to the film's imperfections. While it soared to unparalleled heights, there were moments where the narrative stumbled, a consequence of its ambitious scope. Yet, even in its flaws, The Dark Knight transcended the confines of a mere superhero saga, venturing into the realms of psychological thriller and societal **** a cinematic landscape often inundated with formulaic hero tales, The Dark Knight emerged as a brooding, thought-provoking opus, leaving an indomitable mark on both the superhero genre and film history itself. So, let us raise a metaphorical glass to Nolan's magnum opus \u2013 a dark knight indeed, shining a bat-signal on the cinematic horizon. Cheers to the shadows that linger long after the credits roll."

Unlike the previous film, which was centered on Bruce Wayne and this was his greatest achievement, here the mistakes of the previous films were repeated and we had a Batman-oriented film. Unfortunately, Batman was not used properly, and this makes Bill's performance terrible. He cannot leave a mark on it. Let me explain further: In the movie, Bruce believes that organized crime is over and Harvey Dent, as the white knight, can fill his place. But wasn't Bruce himself orphaned by a common thief? Let Ras Al Ghul and Joker be so that you can say there are crimes in the city?! The movie is in a hurry. What does that mean? It means that after the great battle between Batman and Joker and the end of his plan, the movie should have finished the Harvey Dent/Two-Face issue. The problem is not with Harvey's character or Aaron Oakhart's performance, but this character could have been in the movie. The third is to play a better role and make it better."

I do however have some complaints about it, especially since it ranks so high on IMDB next to movies like The Godfather 1 and 2, which I must say are in a league of their own when compared to this movie. Heath Ledger was a great Joker no doubt about it but if you remove him from this movie it's just another batman movie similar to the first and third Nolan Batman films. The other villains like Two-Face are very forced and generic. Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne is decent but far from perfect; the story itself is not bad but nothing majorly cinematic. Not saying it's a bad movie but in what world is this top 3 on IMDB? I mean cmon Heath Ledger is good as the joker but compare his acting to say James Gandolfini in The Sopranos over an 86-episode series and it's not even close. Overall I would say a B+ movie."

The shaky camerawork and rapid editing, while aiming for intensity, often result in confusion, leaving audiences struggling to follow the on-screen chaos...\n\n\nOne of the film's central characters, Harvey Dent, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, undergoes a dramatic transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful vigilante. Unfortunately, this evolution feels rushed and lacks the nuanced exploration it deserves, leaving the character with a one-dimensional quality that diminishes the impact of his crucial role in the narrative...\n\n\nThe romantic subplot involving Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent, despite the considerable talents of the cast, fails to resonate emotionally. The underdeveloped relationships make it challenging for viewers to invest in the characters' personal struggles, weakening the film's overall emotional impact...\n\n\nAs the plot unfolds, keen-eyed viewers may notice narrative conveniences and plot holes that strain the film's credibility. The Joker's elaborate plans, relying on precise timing and improbable events, may leave some questioning the internal logic of the story, taking away from the immersion that a film of this magnitude should provide...\n\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is set against the backdrop of Gotham City, a city teeming with potential for rich exploration. Regrettably, the film falls short in delivering a comprehensive examination of the city and its societal dynamics. The limited exploration of Gotham leaves the film feeling somewhat insular, missing an opportunity to elevate its narrative to a broader and more profound level...\n\n\nIn conclusion, while \"The Dark Knight\" boasts undeniable strengths, including standout performances and visually striking moments, it's crucial to acknowledge its flaws. The muddled action, inconsistent character development, underwhelming romantic subplot, narrative conveniences, and limited exploration of its vibrant backdrop prevent the film from achieving the unanimous praise it often receives."

                    "review": "Prepare yourselves for a cinematic disaster of epic proportions in Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight,\" a film that somehow managed to achieve the unthinkable: it turned the concept of superhero movies into a tiresome, overrated mess. From the convoluted plot to the lackluster performances, this movie is a prime example of how misguided direction can ruin even the most beloved franchises. First and foremost, let's address the so-called \"masterpiece\" of a plot. Nolan's attempt at complexity and depth falls flat on its face, leaving me more confused than intrigued. The film's narrative is an unnecessarily convoluted mess, with countless unnecessary subplots and characters that do nothing but contribute to the overall chaos. The Joker's so-called \"brilliant\" plan is nothing more than a series of contrived events that are pointless and evil just for the sake of it without any meaningful motive or conviction. Moving on to the performances, it's shocking to see such a talented cast deliver performances that are, at best, forgettable. Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman lacks the gravitas and emotional depth needed for a character of such complexity. Heath Ledger's Joker, touted as a groundbreaking performance, is nothing more than an over-the-top caricature, complete with forced laughter and cringe-worthy dialogue that tries too hard to be epic and impactful despite ending up being the complete contrary. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, fails to add any substance to the film. The film's visual style is often praised, but in reality, it's a hodgepodge of dark and gritty aesthetics that add nothing to the overall experience. The incessant use of shaky cam during action sequences is not only nauseating but also serves as a convenient cover-up for lackluster choreography and uninspired fight **** of the most egregious sins of \"The Dark Knight\" is its excessive runtime. Clocking in at an unbearable two and a half hours, the film overstays its welcome, it has an agonizingly slow pace that makes even the most ardent Batman fans, like myself, question their loyalty to the franchise. In conclusion, \"The Dark Knight\" is a prime example of how hype and marketing can elevate a mediocre film to undeserved heights. From its incoherent plot to uninspired performances, there's little to salvage from this cinematic catastrophe. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this overrated mess masquerading as a superhero epic."

Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied.

In the beginning it starts off as an interesting story with interesting characters. By the middle, the film starts to get brutal and heavy. While in the end it becomes incredibly **** movie is shot beautifully, the fact that it was shot black and white is perfect, because it captures the feel of the 40s. The acting performances are outstanding from Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley. While watching this film I wasn't thinking how great the acting was, because who I saw were characters, they felt like characters and not actors. It's no question that this is one of the o best films of all time."

True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the **** treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."

It's about Jews getting saved from certain death in **** concentration camps by Oscar Schindler, a wealthy man who first only looks to exploit their near free labour, but then also finds his inner humanity. I really love almost everything about this movie, especially the black & white filming. The only things I dislike are that the expulsion from the Jews' homes is only shown in, like, one house. I don't really know anything about Oscar Schindler how he actually was, but in the end he gets portrayed as a sort of messiah, someone who is altruistic beyond repair and I don't know if it was deliberate, or accurate, but it still seemed very odd.\nA great movie, that everyone should have seen at least once in their life."

                    "review": "Real Rating: 91/100\nStrong and persuasive without being visceral. Schindler's List touches on the lives of many without feeling too sentimental to its subjects. It wants to be objective and given what we have seen throughout the history of cinema, propaganda and jingoism. One needs an honest look at the tragedies of humanity.\n\nBE: It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and like Coppola, he spent the first little while trying to emulate it and then decided to just shoot whatever he wanted. The film is pure vision and drive. Everyone on set put in their best performance, and as always Spielberg's sequencing is outstanding, and most should be jealous with how easily he pulls it off. The editing is high class. With only a few issues here or there. It is incredible to think in a 195-minute movie that there are not huge chunks that you could remove, but somehow the editing has kept this behemoth of a film moving along at a steady pace.\n\nW: The dialogue is quite good, but one cannot help but feel that there is a touch of the Hollywood pen in the script, and it is Zaillian writing, so that goes without saying. Other than the faux tension ratching, it is very decent.\n\nC: Arguably Kaminski's best film, though the argument against that is Saving Private Ryan. So you can decide for yourself. That said, other than a few stutters with the camera. Like in the shot where they are bringing the lens down from the bridge to the boat. The film is shot perfectly for how you want this story to be portrayed, and that is what cinematography is supposed to do, it is supposed to accentuate the story. And the girl in red scene shall remain one of my favourites of all time. The shower scene aside, the visual effects excellent.\n\nA: Liam Neeson's best role, before he showed the world that much like Harrison Ford, he plays the same character in almost every film. Thankfully at this point, he is still fresh. Ralph Fiennes built a career from this role, and he would remain a constant in parts in need of snivelling yet powerful monsters for years after, but no character has matched his performance in Schindler's List and rightly so it is a convincing portrayal of a man lost in his convictions yet still has a shred of the humanity that existed in him before the war. Kingsley is excellent with a subdued performance, which is usually the best Kingsley, Sexy Beast aside. It gives Neeson's performance something to bounce off and allow for a better emotional understanding of the character.\n\nS: The sound is excellent, and the score is terrific. So much so it does make me ponder whether Spielberg's film would be the same without it? Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.\n\nPD: Is excellent save for the few touches in the concentration camps and only the most anal filmgoers are going to pick up on that.\n\nBA: Authentic and eye-catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes and the black-white filming does prevent it from being a little higher as it could be hiding a plethora of errors, but as is seen, it is well done.\n\nEVO: This is not a relaxing Tuesday flick, but it is a flick anyone with a love of films or humanity should see. I have not seen many people who have disliked it, Rita Kempley aside. It is a tough watch for some, but it is rewarding in its own way.\u00a0"

The movie has been criticised in some quarters both for making Schindler a more noble character than he perhaps was in real life, and for leaving out many of the worst atrocities of the period. As Spielberg himself has argued however these were both necessary changes in a movie intended for mainstream cinematic release, and this remains an important and incredibly effective piece of cinema on one of the toughest subjects any director can attempt to cover."

It shows how opportunism brings out the worst in people, and that comrades will turn into wolves to preserve what's left of their own power. It's for that reason that Ozcar Schindler's turnaround to help as many jews as he possible can is touching and redeeming. The hate, tiranny and monstrosity of the Gestapo and SS are on full display, as this is just one of the many camps where guards and camp leaders would gruesomely misuse their power. Heartbraking, that's the only word i can think of now.\n\nAn incredibely astonishing and emotional movie still in 2019. I give this movie a 10/10."

This is easily one of the greatest films ever made, and is honestly better than the original Godfather."

It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.\n\nFor one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.\n\nThe acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

It's unbelievable how much Godfather: Part II did and it's damn hard to choose which part was better, it's more a personal preference. Personally, I'm leaning a little towards number one, but it really doesn't mean that the second part is worse. It is as masterful as the previous one and overall it is a MASTERPIECE and MUST-SEE film."

The constant switching between time periods makes this film less engaging to watch.

So is \"The Godfather Part II,\" which is not only superior to the original but has a serious claim to being my favorite movie of all time. While Marlon Brando's presence is sorely missed, \"Part II\" does everything the original did and does it better. Its story is deeper, richer, and ultimately more thought provoking. While \"Part I\" was a tale of good and evil, \"Part II\" explores the Mafia as the ultimate perversion of the American Dream - something that took the innocence of the immigrant ideal and warped it into a criminal monstrosity. \"Part I\" showed how a good man can become evil. \"Part II\" continues that story and demonstrates how an amoral but complicated man can lose his own soul in doing what he thinks is right. Like \"Part I,\" \"Part II\" is endlessly entertaining but it's also more emotionally involving and satisfying. I love how the filmmakers show the parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone, who're both played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The fact that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar for \"Part II\" is unbelievable; it's easily the best performance of his career. In fact everyone in \"Part II\" is great, from Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton to John Cazale. Like \"Part I\" the writing, directing, and music of \"Part II\" are flawless and make for some of the greatest scenes in movie history. \"The Godfather Part II\" is an unqualified masterpiece and essential viewing for anyone who loves movies. 10/10."

            "review": "All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."

It's just so heartwarming and said to see the journey all the characters took and all the sacrifices for a doomed undertaking but they had to do it because it was the only thing they could do because there was still hope.\n\nAnd eventually fixed just looks amazing in this movie there sometimes you can see some bits here there, but it keeps the charm up. I think because you know they kept every special effects tricks to make this movie and it shows.\n\nThis movie is so Earnest I love it and because the actors also good. They can say the corny dialogue and it doesn't sound corny it sounds good. Maybe even great. It makes me rise from my seed and just like layer. Let's ride to our Doom"

It perfectly captures the spirit and scope of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece, while adding its own cinematic magic and emotional depth. The film is a triumph of storytelling, cinematography, music, and acting, with every element working together to create a masterpiece.\n\nI have watched The Return of the King so many times that I've lost count, and it still manages to amaze me every time. The film's battle sequences are some of the most intense and exhilarating I've ever seen, while its quieter moments are filled with emotion and meaning. The acting is superb, with each character delivering a powerful and unforgettable performance. The music by Howard Shore is a masterpiece in its own right, elevating the film to even greater heights.\n\nThe Return of the King is a fitting conclusion to the journey of Frodo, Sam, and the rest of the Fellowship, and it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. It is a film that rewards multiple viewings, as each time you watch it, you discover something new and profound. It is a true masterpiece of cinema, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. 10/10."

I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMy only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.\n\nDespite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.\n\nThe score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.\n\nThe acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.\n\nAll in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy"

My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."

Directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, this courtroom drama takes place almost entirely in a jury room, where twelve men deliberate the fate of a young man accused of murder. The film is a gripping exploration of justice, prejudice, and the power of persuasion. Each character represents a different perspective and brings their own biases to the table, creating intense conflicts and thought-provoking discussions. Henry Fonda delivers a standout performance as Juror #8, the voice of reason who challenges the others to reexamine their assumptions.What makes '12 Angry Men' truly remarkable is its ability to keep the audience engaged despite its limited setting. The tension builds gradually as the jurors clash and reveal their hidden motivations. The film cleverly uses camera angles and close-ups to highlight the emotional intensity and the changing dynamics within the **** screenplay, written by Reginald Rose, is sharp and intelligent, weaving together compelling dialogue and complex character development. It raises important questions about the flaws in the legal system and the impact of personal biases on the pursuit of **** ensemble cast delivers stellar performances, with each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, adding to the authenticity of the jury room atmosphere.Overall, '12 Angry Men' is a masterclass in storytelling and an enduring cinematic achievement. It challenges our notions of justice and forces us to confront our own biases. With its timeless themes and superb performances, this film remains a must-watch for any lover of thought-provoking cinema."

At the end the number 3 take reason because is tired and nobody listen. The reason why the number 3 said the suspect was guilty is because the young man came poor slum of New York City. But is also because number 3 is an old men and is think every young people are bad dangerous or stupid so the suspect was basicly guilty. I appreciate this film because it represents the society of today. But also I think it represents the society at fifties with the racist mentality. In the film the number 3 is racist but everyone of other number said anything except the number 8, so I thing it's not really different. The Clothes proof that because the only was wear in white is number 8 and the other is in black.

In order to describe this period, the only characters are 12 jurors. They all seem to be more ore less wealthy and powerful. We can find for example a salesman, a director, somebodywho works in a bank, an old man, and even a european who migrated to the USA. But they all have a common point: they are all white mens. In fact, this describes well this society, because they are neither black people nor women. This gives a sort of superiority to the white mens in the society, by also making it more general, because we don't know where the scene happens and when it happens. Moreover, it also describes the society, thanks to two other reasons. The first one is the consensus. In fact, when most of people vote to choose if the boy from the slum is guilty or not, some of them simply follow the vote.There is no really room for difference. What's more, some of them aren't even interestedby the vote or don't have any opinions. They just want the judgement to be as fast as possible, as they don't really care about it and only want to enjoy their own life. For example, one wanted to be at a sport game who began at 8.00pm. To conclude, this movie is a great movie, because it describes and make a review of the society after the WW2 in the USA by explaining that everything that was important is the social class. This film is a work of artmade in order to describe how people lived at that time. Nowadays, aretists like Banksy also make reviews from the society, by painting,or also making movies, by using art. So we can ask ourselves, if, art will allow humans to express their feelings and emotions forever."

But someone made a movie about it: Henry Fonda and he succeeded. It begins with a strange atmosphere; this is a very hot day, the judge don't seem interested about the case, neither the jury. What's more we know nothing; there isn't any details about the case, we don't here the lawyers and we barely see the guilty's face. Then you don't understand everything at first, and that's in my opinion the quality of the film. You learn more and more details and facts as the story goes on. That's why you're always in waiting with the need to know more. At first they all say \"guilty\" but of course there would not be a story if someone wasn't disagreeing; the juror 8 played by Fonda himself"

Ifsomeone else that number 8 was there at his seat maybe the bey couldn t ab survive the **** an exemple, when they started to arguing about the lanife, when the juror that lived in a slum explained he transmitted lanowledge. This is the first part of the social link they all learned and made learn something. An other exemple is number three's opinion about the boy, he judged him personally and assimilate him to his son.With anger he torn his picture with his son then he fell under pressure and went to tears. To go straight to the point the thing we need to stop on about this film is remarquable.Judging a life and being totally, neutral is impossible."

And sure as I presumed it would happen like that but this isn't a mystery. This is not a who dun it,instead it's a philosophical quandary on the the ethics of truth. It's objective is to show just how easily one's idea of the truth can change and what that can be done by which is especially relevant to the time period of the 50's. It effectively through exaggerated characters confronts classism, racism, macarthisim and generational divides without making it's intent glaringly obvious .

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

Throughout the film he manages to make us think and doubt in the company of the jurors without ever getting bored. Jurors with very different personalities and a very strong character that brings this room to life in which they find themselves but also intrigued the viewer. Throughout this film we have the impression that we are participating in the debate at the same time as them, we listen to their doubts, their arguments, we even manage to ask questions. In this film it is not a question of certainty but of constant doubt about this accused young boy. To meditate on racism and prejudices too often highlighted in similar situations. A remarkable 1.5 hour film where 12 men manage to keep us going until the end."

Indeed, even if it was released more than sixty years ago it sounds very current and contemporary. Themes of racism, acceptance of the others and their differences, death penalty, to quote only these ones, are approached by the director, Sydney Lumet, in a very pertinent way : every juror represents one or more aspects of the society or human characteristics, faint or praiseworthy. For example, we can find in the character of the juror #6 a representation of quiet workers who think that they don\u2019t deserve to express their opinions, we can see too in the juror #8 the illustration of the Platonic idea that the debates and considered discussions allow to find the truth or the best thing to do to find a solution to a problem. 12 angry men is very deep because of that, but also because of the many parallels made with the New Testament of the Bible (for example, the jurors are 12 like Jesus\u2019 apostles) and well-made camera angles and movements, which reinforce the multiple feelings that the director conveys by way of his characters\u2019 behavior and speeches. In short, I think it\u2019s not too much to say that 12 angry men is a piece of art of chief importance ; it\u2019s very successful, especially for a first movie."

The film shows us that it can be complicated to take an important decision, when we are not the only concerned person. Indeed, throughout the film, with the different points of view of the 12 jurors, we ask us what will be the verdict of the accused, that creates an interesting plot for the spectators ! Also, there are a lot of biblical comparaisons that show us the believer aspect of the american society at this time.  So, this film is interesting, because it stages different themes and aspects of the american society in the late fifties, and especially the fact to know to live in society and take decisions together. But it has also a critical vision about ideas of this time, which are very well staged ! I think that this movie can please those like plot and the art of debate !"

But I have a mixed opinion because even if there are some details that I dislike, and even if there are many tensions between the characters, we can understand their point of view about the accused of the murder all along the film, and by the way we can understand their background and their personnality. As a teenager, I liked this film because all the characters have different opinions, way of speaking and maybe I found inspiration on a few of them because they convinced me. So maybe it will help me to lead a debate in the future, and more usually to be sure of myself when I'll have to find a job, to convince people for something, because I would have learned some process, tips to speak easily.

This film takes us in the United-States during the 1950\u2019s with the Cold War context, and a lot of racism and xenophobia in the society. The different characters, played by famous and talented actors ( like Henry Fonda), show the variety of citizens at this time. We can also find a lot of interesting religious references.

Create communication and safe dialogue is one of them.People may not be obliged to be stuck with their values, they can share opinions and become  more aware of what's surrounding them.

Tarantino's signature style is on full display here, with dynamic camera angles, non-linear storytelling, and a vibrant mix of colors that saturate the screen. The cinematography, spearheaded by the talented Andrzej Sekula, is a cocktail of grit, glamour, and sheer audacity. It's a visual symphony that grabs you by the collar and immerses you in the gritty underworld of crime.\n\nSoundtrack:\nNow, let's talk about the soundtrack. Oh, my God, this soundtrack is like the holy grail of cool. From surf rock to soul, from Chuck Berry to Urge Overkill's rendition of \"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon,\" every track is a character in itself, carefully curated to enhance the narrative. It's an auditory journey that seamlessly weaves into the film's fabric, creating an atmosphere that's as eclectic as it is unforgettable.\n\nScript and Dialogue:\nTarantino's writing, as always, is a star player. The dialogue in \"Pulp Fiction\" is sharp, witty, and utterly unpredictable. It's like a verbal ballet of pop culture references, mundane discussions, and philosophical musings. The way Tarantino can make a conversation about hamburgers or foot massages as tense as a Mexican standoff is nothing short of genius. The film is a testament to the power of dialogue in storytelling.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in \"Pulp Fiction\" are a motley crew of misfits, hitmen, and Bonnie and Clyde types. Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield, Mia Wallace \u2013 these characters have become iconic in their own right. The casting, from John Travolta's charismatic dance moves to Samuel L. Jackson's Bible-quoting intensity, is pitch-perfect. The ensemble cast delivers knockout performances, adding layers of depth to characters that could easily have been one-dimensional in less capable hands.\n\nStory Structure:\nNow, the non-linear narrative structure. Some may find it disorienting, but in the hands of Tarantino, it's a stroke of storytelling brilliance. The intertwining of seemingly disparate storylines creates a mosaic that keeps you guessing, engaged, and eager for the next narrative twist. It's a structure that demands your attention and rewards you with a satisfying puzzle once the pieces fall into place.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of cinema, \"Pulp Fiction\" stands as a bold, rule-breaking masterpiece. Tarantino's magnum opus is a rollercoaster of violence, humor, and existential pondering. It's a film that refuses to be pigeonholed, effortlessly blending genres and creating a cinematic experience that's as unique as it is influential.\n\nI'm giving \"Pulp Fiction\" a solid 10 out of 10. It's a classic that continues to resonate, captivate, and inspire filmmakers to this day."

A magnificent non-linearly filed plot with several papallelic stories. Chic cast and a few iconic scenes. Pulp Fiction has both neo-noir and black humour. Pulp Fiction is a cultural phenomenon that will be relevant outside of time, this film has had a great influence not only on the genre, but also on the entire world cinematographer. After almost 30 years, no one else took off something better than Tarantino. Not many movies like Pulp Fiction have so many parodies and references in other movies or TV shows"

The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

At first I wasn't sure I could see a lot of substance between the various sub plots but by the end, I admit it did come together reasonably well. The key moments, to me, were Uma Thurman dancing with Travolta in the diner/bar and Jules talking about his dislike for eating anything he regards as dirty (never mind the irony/hypocracy that he kills people for a living). There is some dark comedy, although it didn't entirely appeal to me but I can understand why other people really like it. It was interesting to see the director in such a long-ish scene towards the end - usually, from the films I've seen anyway, when the film director or writer (Stan Lee etc.) appears in their film, as a cameo of sorts, it tends to be a pretty brief and often dialogue free occurence but not this time, although I can't say I liked the strongly racist language used but generally this is a good film of its sort I suppose. I liked the scene with Tim Roth's character, Pumpkin, in his self inflicted scenario (which we see briefly at the start) being played out towards the end.\n\nI also remembered that there was a large movie poster of this film up in the classroom I used to study media studies in, in the late 90s, so that was a slight flashback. Pulp Fiction was on one wall and Assassins with Stallone and Banderas was on the other one I think - oh and 'Peter's Friends' on another wall I think but I haven't seen that film yet(!).\n\nIf it sounds of interest to you then yes, I'd recommend it, although if your either reasonably squeamish and/or don't like hard drug use or sexual violence hinted at (although not explicitly shown, or not in the film version I saw anyway), then this would be best avoided I suppose."

With that said, Tarantino exceeds this expectation by brilliantly intertwining the short stories to create what has always been in front of our faces; a cohesive and engrossing thriller. The scenes and lines delivered by the excellent cast have appropriately cemented themselves into pop culture as people continue to quote them 26+ years later. Both a silly celebration and a serious piece of artwork, \"Pulp Fiction\" is sublime."

Pulp Fiction follows 3 stories that are interwoven through out the movie as the movie progresses the stories begin to unravel and interweave connecting a bloody, strange, tiresome, accidental week into an amazing movie. The setting and characters are amazing and completely fleshed out to mimic real people from the real city of Los Angles. The point of the movie wasn't supposed to be real though it was supposed to take these scary killers and put a comedic twist in their life. While Pulp Fiction is really good I think \"time interweaving\" should be a little fleshed out. The movie goes back into time once and while it was cool I think Tarantino should have used time interweaving a bit more but I am still glad he did not over weave it making it a confusing mess that'll feel like a chore to unravel. 9/10, one of the greatest and most original movie Hollywood has had so far."

Many may under look 1994s \"Pulp Fiction\" as nothing more then a goofy story and a cult classic. This was the general impression I was under prior to watching. I was wrong however. Pulp fiction instead turned out to be humorous, well acted as with all QT films, incredibly well directed as well as a complex story line that actually works. See, I get that some people may dislike what QT did here with all the time shifts and may leave puzzled or confused by, but I among many others think its incredibly clever. Why is it clever exactly? I don't know. In a way its stupid and ridiculous and may even lack a point to the whole story, but that's what makes it so special. You see two (or three) men's journey and how there world is interconnected. In the midst of all this is gruesome action, humor, is a deep metaphorical message, and dialogue that is worth the watch alone. What I like so much about QT flicks is how he leaves the viewer either puzzled, amazed, shocked or disgusted. In this case Pulp fiction will have you feeling all the above. My only main complaint about this movie is the somewhat lackluster ending. I still get why they ended it the way they did but I feel like it was to much of a buildup to have a subpar \"ending\", again we as the viewer have to ask ourselves when the true ending was. That i wont spoil. In all, you will either hate or love pulp fiction. I challenge you to figure that out for yourself."

So a few hours ago I visited his \"Masterpiece\" as labelled by the audience , The one and only \"PULP FICTION\" . Even as a huge fan of his I cannot hold back but criticize that this movie was huge disappointment for me . It would've been a great movie if it was directed by some other guy but the bar has been set up too high by Quentin and I personally feel he's not even close to it . Though the movie starts brilliantly and almost drags you in their world ( That adrenaline scene . Wow!!!!)\nBut the second half is where I feel I was watching something else and it kind of felt dragged , it's not to say that it's the actor's fault , no not at all!! . They have given there very best ( especially John Travolta) but I feel the second half is not upto the mark . One might criticize that character development in the movie is what's so great about this movie and I believe it's true , but to my taste I feel there is not enough of plot development unlike Tarantino's other movies . All and all it's a good movie and a one time watch for me"

I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"

He needs to be a likable sad Guy.\n\nThe visuals are still amazing. It looks so good. There are some scenes where they use 3D puppets and character for a meme guy in the minds that I ice couldn't not look at but all the other things look amazing and the painting they used in the background and special effects and many sneaky ways they used the camera as to make the hobbits look smaller than they are.\n\nactors  amazing job they made this story with is a bit hokey and cringe sometimes but they sell it it never feels cringe it feels so honest and believable despite. How old fashioned fantasy it is.\n\nI have watched this movie a lot of times and I still tear up at some points. I still get emotional and if I still do that that means that the movie still has a lot of value and sentimental abilities and honest and wholesome and friendly bromance between every character is what I need."

Tolkien's epic world. The story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to destroy the One Ring is told with such precision and care that it's impossible not to become fully invested in the fate of Middle-earth.\n\nThe performances of the cast are simply outstanding, with Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen delivering some of the most memorable performances in film history. Howard Shore's score adds an extra layer of emotion to every scene, capturing the grandeur and danger of Middle-earth.\n\nI have watched The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring so many times, and each time I am still captivated by its beauty and power. This is a film that deserves to be seen and cherished by generations to come. It truly deserves a perfect score of 10/10."

Its first volume, like the other two, has earned a colossal success as what it genuinely deserves. It has been nominated as well as acquired numerous sets of awards \u2013 proof of its extraordinaire quality, one can say. Nonetheless, it is indeed worth watching, for it is a one-in-a-million obra maestra. As a prime testament, the plot, graphics, cinematography, and the ensemble cast are noteworthy. It transcended the people\u2019s expectations and the \u201cstandard.\u201d  The storyline is simply phenomenal. And in regard to its visuals, even with small CGI used, it is exceptionally good to the eye, especially with its ably-detailed, well-designed and proficiently-crafted studio backgrounds, props, and wardrobes, not to mention, the real settings. Furthermore, the iconic characters are played by outstanding actors (Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, etc.) which makes the acting and scenes more memorable, and impactful. Besides, it contains good humor, too - from the characters, especially the Dwarf. It is convincing that each one\u2019s individual and group performances connect us to the characters deeper and let us feel all sorts of emotions such as happiness, pain, sorrow, and nostalgia \u2013 which is great.\nAlso, its musical scores bring you excitement, at the same time, tranquility. They\u2019re all \u201cmusically complex, with certain themes constantly winding in and out of individual pieces to reinforce motifs and emotion.\u201d (Cummins, 2018) Somehow, we, the audience, are manipulated and unknowingly make us dive into the screen with these serene splashes of sounds \u2013 an ideal match in an entertainment. And although this story is fictional, the messages, and the circumstances in the story depict realities in life. As it unfolded, it revealed a lot of lessons that are relevant in our lives. One of them can be reflected in the quote of the character named Gandalf, who said that \u201cAll we must decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\u201d It reminds us of how abstract our lives can be in a lifetime. Truly, the movie has always been popular with the general audience, may it be from kids to adults, because it is undeniably a great piece of art. The nuggets of wisdom that could be acquired in this film are tremendous, and watching it multiple times will surely make you say that it never gets old. It is even getting more interesting, in the second time around for one could see more intricate details of the movie that you might have missed before. For me, to put all of it simply, on a scale of 1-10, this film is a perfect one hundred. And if one haven\u2019t watched it yet, what all we can say is \u201cYou missed a half-cycle of your life, my precious.\u201d"

The direction was wonderful, as was the idea of \u200b\u200bshooting everything in New Zealand."

Until two weeks ago, My friend came and asked me: \u201cAre you interested in movies about theory or science?\u201d I told him I really liked it and I also like action movies. So he recommended \u2018Inception\u2019 to me and he invited me to watch it together.\nThe plot of the movie is about stealing ideas through dreams. Dom Cobb, the man who founded the intelligence espionage team. He is the best at entering dreams and steal valuable secrets from the subconscious of the target who is asleep. One day Cobb and the team meets an influential Japanese businessman named Saito who will hire Cobb to go on some missions in exchange for his return to the country without guilt. But instead, he hires Cobb to steal some information inside his rival mind. The mission turned out to be the opposite. When he wanted Cobb and his team to implant an idea into the mind of the son of the owner of his rival company. But it seems the new mission isn't as easy as it seems. When everything doesn't go as planned. As a result, Cobb and his team face more and more dangers on each floor of their dreams.\nWhile watching, I was surprised by the film production. Whether it's the actors, the plot, the setting, or the story. This movie is very interesting. It's a sci-fi action movie. Suitable for people who like movies with unexpected plots. Can't guess anything. This movie will keep our brains working for 2 and a half hours because it has many complicated theories. But it's full of interest with an unbeatable plot and the concept of Lucid dream, the most intricate. And I think that in that era, Inception was a very cutting edge movie. Because time probably won't be able to do anything about it. Even I came to see it after the movie had been shown for ten years. I'm still amazed by the plot, visuals and sounds, or scenes that I don't think ten years ago anyone would have thought of something like this. I don't know how Nolan's brain came up with something like this. The part that enhances the movie to fulfill the imagination of the viewer very well is probably the CG and the most spectacular cinematography. Each scene was created through Nolan\u2019s detailed thought process. Such as the scenes of the dream collapsing, the folding city, or the dream from the first floor to the last floor all create excitement for me very well.\nI think Inception is a pretty difficult movie to watch. Because it takes thinking about the whole thing. Think along the storylines and characters. You may have to watch it two or more times to understand and relate to the movie more. Although it may be difficult to understand at first. But I would recommend watching this movie. Lastly, for Nolan's films, I would definitely rank this one as my favorite of his. I really love this !"

I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. \"Why he is keeping her in his dreams?\" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents  are not managing that well."

The script is concise, intelligent and truly in a league of its own in terms of ambitious complexity. The directing is as exceptional as you would expect from Christopher, focusing on right detailed shots,muted tones,melancholy piano heavy scores and ambitious endings.

The way in which the storyline is structured is very impressive and the casting has been carefully thought through which is something most blockbuster films have failed to accomplish in recent years. Page's performance as Ariadne is debatable but nothing worth 'over-ranting' about. The CGI in the movie is magnificent but isn't over done, making it very appropriate and entertaining when used. One thing is for certain and that is that Nolan has definitely brought the best out of the actors in Inception, particular Tom Hardy who plays the role of Eames near enough pitch perfect. With a combination of stars, effects, performances, action, strong narrative & superb direction, it's hard to pick out any major faults with Inception. A must, must see."

Why are the characters here, what are they trying to accomplish and why didn't they just do this in a less risky, less convoluted way? Coupled with a bunch of obnoxious, forgettable characters such as the stereotypical girl that constantly asks annoying questions pile needless,nonsensical and often contradictory exposition onto the viewer and it's a movie where I don't care about the characters nor the stakes."

It was too smart for them then, and, if they can't admit how wrong they were then, it is still too smart for them now. This is both filmmaking and story telling in general to sheer perfection. Like when making soap, all the fat of the source material had been boiled down, both expertly and sweetly repackaged, and then sold back to us at an extremely higher value. This is Art at it's highest level. That is, when art redefines the way art is made and transforms the medium as a whole overtime. David Fincher again changes the way movies are absorbed. This movie transcends the simple 4 act structure, it transcends the movie industry in general and instead reaches out to the masses of the frustrated, the under appreciated lower-middle class. Struggling from paycheck to paycheck whilst being mercilessly drowned by marketing campaigns. Brain washed into a state of hyper consumerism. Desperate for a hero, any hero, even an anti-hero. Enter Tyler Durden, the savior of the modern man. And, David Fincher a creator of worlds. Worlds you just wish you could reach into the screen and enter like Toby Maguire in Plesantville. The book is brilliant. The adapted screenplay is brilliant. The Brad Pitt the Edward Norton and especially the Helena Bonham Carter, all brilliant. and Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto... etc etc. The cgi is a tad dated but no one cares because the cinematography is consistently gorgeous and the musical score kicks way to much ass to notice. If Fight Club isn't considered to be a perfect movie by film critics, then a redefining of the words \"perfect movie\" should also be considered by film critics. flashback humor"

The film tells the story of a man experiencing an existential crisis who creates a movement, and it is elevated by the dynamic performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt as unlikely partners, and Helena Bonham Carter as the quirky Marla Singer. The film's originality, part-time drama, part-time dark comedy, and its themes of existentialism, masculinity and consumerism have made it a timeless classic. While the film may feel a bit dated at times, it's undeniable that 'Fight Club' has left an indelible mark on cinema and pop culture.\n__________________\n'Fight Club' de David Fincher se ha convertido en un fen\u00f3meno cultural desde su lanzamiento, con sus personajes ic\u00f3nicos, di\u00e1logos ingeniosos y narraciones \u00fanicas.

La originalidad de la pel\u00edcula, el drama a tiempo parcial, la comedia negra a tiempo parcial y sus temas de existencialismo, masculinidad y consumismo la han convertido en un cl\u00e1sico atemporal.

The last half hour especially is some of the most creative and moving stuff I've seen in mainstream cinema!\nEverybody should see this movie at least once and make up their mind about it.\n\nPS: Don't start real life fight clubs, if you took that away from the movie, you probably haven't watched it."

The best role of Edwarth Northan in his career and perhaps one of the most interesting finals, turning the plot 180 degrees. It's hard to find a more benchmark thriller, David Fincher has done a great job. Fight Club is an out-of-time movie, a classic of the thriller genre that will always be relevant."

Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

The music was really good, the cinematography is outstanding. There were few impossibly beautiful shots, for example the tree in the sunset. The only criticism I have is that the three old guys in the bar didn't age much throughout the 30-40 years, but the point of their existence was the humor, which was on point. Overall, this is among the best movies of all time."

Tom Hanks has one of the best performances ever captured and the supporting cast is equally as good. The movie has incredible drama, comedy, romance but then transports you to one of the better war sequences and battles you've seen captured during Vietnam. There's no shortage of incredible vignettes of American history that imbeds you with American nostalgia. Also some of the cinematography and shots make you fall in love with the look of America all over again. Even though some of the source material is very heavy, you get to laugh a lot, and you will feel inspired at the end and hope you can see the world just a little bit how Forrest does.\n\nSetting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax: A+\n\nAudience Engagement (do you feel runtime): No\n\nTop Genres - Drama, Romance (Fiction)\n\nRuntime - 2:22\n\nGenre(s) rating -Drama: 9 -Romance: 8\n\nGenre Average Score: 8.5 Directing: 9 Cinematography/lighting: 10 Story/Narrative: 9 Structure: 8 Dialogue: 10 Score(music): 10 Editing: 9 Acting: 10 Characterization: 10 Mise en Sc\u00e8ne/Visual Design: 10 Visual Effects: 9 Costumes/Makeup: 8 Lasting Impact: 10 Originality: 10\n\nOverall: 9.37"

It follows the story of a mentally challenged boy who through his blind optimimism and impulsive nature goes on to lead an impressive life. The movie grasps at profound ideas and mostly executes them . It does present 2D perspectives on it's peripheral characters such as jenny or bubba never really making them people rather that objects Forest has regards for. It's obvious why this is a classic as it's depiction of American nostalgia is hypnotic and directed with care. I do not think it's a masterpiece but it is admittedly a movie of note."

The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

                    "review": "This is a drama film, with some comedic moments and themes including innocence, kindness, racism, war and the military. The comedy present is a sort of a slapstick, sentimental style of comedy - its hard to explain but I hope that makes sense(?).\n\nIt is quite saccharine sweet in tone for most of the film, with a very light, jaunty piano tune played in the background while Hanks narrates Forrests memories and thoughts about his past, particularly his childhood,  from quite early on. This is regarded as a classic film and as such was a film I'd wanted to see for some time. I felt it had a fairy tale quality to itself and certainly the theme of childhood innocence seemed very present for quite a while. There is something quite endearing about Gump's staunch belief in what his mother (his 'momma') told him, some of which could be hard for us to believe. He has an optimism which is admirable but there is an inevitable feeling of sadness to it as well, for the viewer, as we realise how vulnerable he is and fear what may become of him, in the various situations he finds himself in. I found the film quite engrossing - its definitely a classic case of it being an underdogs tale, although thats not to say that everything goes anywhere near smoothly for him, far from it (I won't elaborate anymore, for obvious (spoiler prevention) reasons).\n\nCast wise, Tom Hanks plays the main role, that of Forrest Gump. He does very well at portrating a person who is clearly mentally challenged (whatever the politically correct term is nowadays, I'm not very keen on the one that starts 'ret...'), thus somewhat baffled by fairly everyday things, situations and the like. As a character, he comes across as quite thoughtful and philosophical and I felt quite sorry for him, given the forms of abuse he had to put up with from others who belittled his issues. Hanks does well at making him seem very much someone you could admire in ways, a sort of perhaps unexpected underdog hero. He does well at portraying a look of bewilderment at times, which I felt to be quite endearing. Other cast members include Sally Field, who plays Forrest's mother, Robin Wright who plays Jenny Curran (Forrest's childhood crush), Mykelti Williamson, who plays Bubba Blue, a fellow US army recruit, Afemo Omilami who plays the rather scary drill sergeant and Gary Sinise, who plays Lieutenant Dan Taylor, among others.\n\nThe music featured in the background is pretty standard, cheesy stuff for the most part, certainly the music played in the background at times. I did feel it was better than some films in terms of keeping the background music fairly quiet, thus it not being too 'in your face' as is the case in some films. There are some rock and soul based songs (including Jimi Hendrix) played at times but overall, I didn't think music played an especially big part in the film overall.\n\nContent wise, the film contains partial nudity and sex references, with scenes in which sex is implied but not specifically shown as such. There are scenes involving drug use, with drug taking paraphernalia. There is also some mild to moderate violence present, with war situations depicted and abuse being inferred. There are some instances of bad language, including a couple of racist terms, although nothing extremely graphic. The film is quite emotional in tone in general, with some scenes being potentially more upsetting than others. Its been given a 12 rating in the UK, to reflect this content.\n\nI'd say this is a film which implies certain societal morals and as such it may seem a little high and mighty/forced perhaps to some cynical types - I'm not overly keen on such films in general but I did feel I appreciated this particular film. Some scenes were quite gripping, although I found myself wondering how likely it could honestly be for someone like Forrest, to have dealt with what he does. I don't feel like this is a film in which I could really criticise it for seeming far too unrealistic, as I felt myself going along with the plot regardless.\n\nI wasn't entirely impressed with the special effects in one or two war based scenes, with explosions looking, shall we say, a little less than entirely realistic, in my eyes anyway. However, I only remember that being an issue in one or two scenes and it hardly ruined the film for me. I'd happily recommend this film."

The film, based on the novel by Winston Groom, tells the story of a mannamed Forrest Gump. Forrest who since childhood was considered a stupid child with an IQ of 75 has a unique life story.Having been belittled by everyone, Forrest continued to go forward with a stupid label by others against him.Forrest Gump is an epic film that makes the audience realize that behind the shortcomings there are many advantages in each **** nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for **** what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character?\n1. Loving Parents\nWe can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean& run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs.Gump is sick.Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle couldn't b reciprocated with **** mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mom is his hero\n2. Always positive and optimistic\nAlthough Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film but his stupidity isn't a problem for a **** keeps going&always thinks **** d film, Forrest always shows his positive nature in any situation&in any **** u copy this 3. Never give up& b generous\nAfter he managed 2 create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp **** and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business.After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp.Forrest Gump didn't give **** tried many times&failed many times.Until one day his shrimp catch was successful& together with Lieutenant Dan he managed 2 create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city.Forrest Gump, who seemed 2 b a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy.Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan & gave his income 2 the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company\n4. Good promise holder\nBubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite **** not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp&Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he'd set up a shrimp company with Forrest but unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield.Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company.Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation.Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true.\n5. NEVER forget friends in any situation\nThe next Forrest Gump trait that u can emulate is that he always helps anyone.u can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with **** again Forrest didn't want 2 forget the Lieutenant **** accidentally meets Lieutenant Dan who turns into a beggar in a wheelchair.\n6. Faithful in love affairs\nThe romance drama between Forrest and Jenny can be a good example for **** single love story between Forrest Gump and Jenny seems to break the audience's heart when they see how loyal Forrest Gump is 2Jenny.Although he had been separated several times for a long time&many times Forrest Gump was rejected by Jenny and many times he saw Jenny's bad side. Forrest remained standing faithfully waiting for **** still loves Jenny with all her flaws.Until finally he&Jenny got married But the marriage did not last long because Jenny had to leave the world early due to a virus due to her wild life.Forrest Gump must have been very sad, Jenny's long-awaited love finally ended **** Forrest Gump, Jenny was his first and last love\n7. Good father\nAt the end of the story, Forrest Gump who has become a father, gives his best love to his **** applies the love he gets from his mother who is also a single parent.Without Jenny's presence, Forrest Gump performed his role appropriately to be a good father to his son."

Followed by an introduction to the main character who tells us her whole life. It was quite a ride. Unbelievable. Quite enjoyable at first. I'd say almost sweet and motivating at the same time. But gradually it got darker and darker, which I liked and it got my attention. It also started playing some music here and there, which was cool. The story of Forrest Gump is cool, but it's not somehow masterful. Still, I have to stand by the fact that this movie has a special charm. It's sweet and dark at the same time. It combines these things into one and in my opinion it works first class. Despite all the sad events, which I won't spoil, the film shows us that you just move on in life and that the next days can be better. That's probably not the main idea of the film, but it just had that effect on me. If I were in the shoes of the main character and experiencing what Forrest Gump does here in the plot, I probably would have had a mental breakdown a long time ago, but Forrest kept going and I liked that. For me, an amazing film and a classic that I think is in the MUST-SEE films. Recommended."

It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song \"Ecstacy of Gold\" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as \"Angel Eyes.\" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as \"Blondie,\" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!"

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.\n\nBut there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.\n\nThe pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.\n\nOverall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

An extremely well crafted movie that can be used in film schools and is entraining. Also a prime example for the show not tell rule. The characters don't use much words but you miss nothing. Everything is told via the scenery, acting, mimic and music. It is the one Western that frequently appears on the top movies of all times list. I must again praise the director and the crafting. Many scenes are done in one shot and are visually impressing. The sets and requisites are mindbogglingly good. They even used time appropriate guns. For some scenes they had Spanish soldiers as extras. Then there are the main actors. Clint Eastwood as \u201cThe Good\u201d in his persona as tight-lipped gunman, Lee van Cleef as \u201cThe Bad\u201d and Eli Wallach as \u201cThe Ugly\u201d. They deliver a flawless performance here and nailed the roles. The acting, gestures and mimic are prime examples for great acting skills and you would not believe that a Western has such a good performance. Then there is the story that is always engaging. A cat and mouse game between the three protagonist. A game of scoundrels. No one can rate this movie without giving Ennio Morricone credits for the soundtrack. Like Sergio Leone said \u201dEnnio Morricone does not make music. He is telling stories with his scores and more of a director\u201d. Here you can see why. His scores improved the scenes and deliver an intensity that I cant describe. Just the final stand-off is of the highest calibre and even if you don't watch the movie you should a least watch it on YouTube. The main theme has transitioned the movie. Everyone has heard it and knows it is from this movie. It is used so many times in other movies, shows and media that I can probably fill a book with it. There is only one flaw in this movie. The synchronisation is horrible in the English version (In German it is O.K). maybe a warning for some. The film is matured and does not shy away from the ugly truth of a lawless area and immoral acts. Overall it is a classic and deserved its place in movie history."

It has great character introductions: Tuco crashing on the glass window, Angel Eyes' standing on the door as if Death is waiting and there is no way out, and of course, Blondie's menacing \"Yeah, but you don't look like the one who'll collect it.\" line. These stylistic introductions by Sergio Leone captures the audience on what is to come.\n\nYup, what is to come is not as dull as the deserts of Spain. It has a very compelling plot which dwells on the morality of the characters in the backdrop of the Civil War. All three characters are crooked gunslingers, their eyes are all focused on the gold but the Civil War would spell their differences. The Bad really is bad, The Ugly do have a displeasing personality, but The Good... we don't even know why he was called one until he comments about how men are wasted in wars. He even offered alcohol and cigar to the dying men of war. The writers did not shy away on portraying the horrors of war because one will know a person's morality on how he views injustice. Does he take advantage of this for personal gain (The Bad), does he go against it (The Good), or just don't care at all (The Ugly). Lastly, the film won't be a cinematic classic without the cinematography and Morricone's score. The combination of these two elements was perfectly executed especially into its climactic ending of the three main character's stare downs and their hands slowly creeping on their guns while Morricone's The Trio is playing on the background. The establishment of eye lines together with camera angles were perfectly executed. Of course, i would not forget the classic intro. I mean that intro is a stable in those western-inspired films whenever there's a stare down happening in the middle of the town.\n\nI believe this is the epitome of Western movies. All the western-inspired films in the modern times definitely stole a lot from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Indeed, a masterpiece in all aspects."

The acting, appropriate to its purpose, retains honesty and integrity; the pathos is impeccable, and the story never takes itself seriously yet still emotes intense emotional response after innumerable viewings. It even manages to sneak in powerful anti-war, anti-discrimination messages, all the more poignant for the Vietnam era in which it was created. Cinematically, the attention to detail is as good as it gets: swathes of panorama balanced with vignettes, facial twitches replace dialogue that would otherwise crush the tension and momentum. Authenticity drips from the staging of every shot. And of course the score, which by any standard must have been ground breaking at the time and is as timeless as the production. Criticism may be levelled at any part of the movie by pedants and professional nitpickers, but the composition of elements integrate into a whole to form a masterpiece that surely remains unparalled. Who would have believed that a Western, and a spaghetti western at that, would have become the Mona Lisa of our times?"

Iconic in every facet, Leone transcends the discriminating image of 'spaghetti westerns' that society projected on his work. The film does have its problems: Eastwood is flat even for his standards, and the multilingual lip-syncing makes the film seem embarrassingly amateuristic at times. But the only thing that sticks is the grandiose imagery, lifted out of mortality by Morricone's masterful score that put him on shortlists beside classical composers. This film is a stylistic masterpiece."

                    "review": "So much runs through the viewer's mind during the climatic graveyard scene near the end The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Somehow, through all we've have been put through for the last 3 hours, the brutality of America's bloodiest war, the many, many twists and turns that we've been put through, the highs and lows of the truly epic journey across America's sun-scorched, anarchic, savage bastard child west, nothing else matters besides what is going right now at this very instance. Despite Morricone's heavenly \"Ecstasy of Gold\" drumming everything, meaning the scene, its characters, the action, and the audience along, it's really a moment of restrained triumph, as Tuco the Ugly frantically gallops across this massive graveyard which more closely resembles some great Roman coliseum in search of the one thing that he could ever mean something to someone like him, some arbitrary object of gratification with which we, the audience, have had dangled in front of us for what feels like an eternity. Suddenly, the whir of excitement and triumph comes to a dead stop. The heavenly mariachi is silent now, and the almost spiritual catharsis which has briefly unified this character, this film, and this audience as one shared soul in search for something greater has finally hit a fever pitch from which words escape. The entire world has stopped and even the Heavens seem to have lent its undivided attention - Tuco has found the gold.\n\nSomehow, despite Clint Eastwood's top-billing and his position firmly at the bottom of the film's title, Tuco scans as the main character of this affair. He sets the adventure in motion, he discovers the gold, and most importantly, he's the one we empathize with, the one we actually care about. Somehow, his greed, his wretchedness, his disregard for anything which could be considered ethical or cosmically important in any way do nothing to hinder our view of him as a sympathetic human being as deserving as anyone of just one moment of satisfaction. He suffers all throughout the movie as some creature who has never been loved or even tolerated by anybody else. He can't even get by for his own brother, who couldn't loathe him any more were he the devil himself. Like many of the greatest characters of the genre - Cormac McCarthy's Judge Holden, Jesse James, among others, he embodies the wild west in human form - an amoral force for chaos that we, against our better instincts, have qualities that we see in ourselves.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is the idealized west and it's also the grim, violent, bleak west. Its gorgeous landscapes that seem to melt like butter across the screen and then some and its gunslinging good guys and bad guys that we can't help but throw our weight behind are all present and accounted for, just as are the harsh, morbid realities that plagued real people that really existed and really felt at this time. It's this atmosphere, of grit and spit and grime and dirt and famine that make The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly as profoundly timeless as they are. This is no surprise coming from Sergio Leone, the man who could make riveting cinema out of 10 uninterrupted moments of three guys waiting for a train in the middle of a desert.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that among this film's many merits is the simple reality of just how ahead of its time this movie was. Its archetypes and arid, scenic backdrops aren't just present in modern fiction, they're almost the bread and butter of a well-told story. Star Wars, Red Dead Redemption, Blood Meridian, Grand Theft Auto, Pulp Fiction, Breaking Bad; just drops in the pan of the vast sum of works of fiction that almost certainly owe more than their fair share of inspiration to this film. We certainly don't love these settings and these characters because they bring out the best in us. There are absolutely no morals, no higher truths with which to ascribe to, and certainly very little compassion on display here. And yet, it would be a difficult position to defend that they bring out the worst in us either, being that they are able to get us to feel tremendously for the plight of even the most wretched characters and see some great redeeming power in the virtue of earnestness for earnestness's sake. Most accurately is that these stories simply bring out the most human in us, and that is the very essence of storytelling itself."

Also, it's a spoiler free review, and it may seem to be a little vague. .\n.\nGood : It's a f**king masterpiece. Don't agree with me? I don't give a s**t. Leone's visual storytelling has never been so great. The scores, the activities of the characters, the scenes were enough to tell the story. The dialogues are simply conversations between the characters. In the entire three hour runtime, there isn't a single expositionary dialogue, except for a total of 5 minutes. That's a very difficult task to do, and it does it with such an ease that we don't even notice it during the first viewing. Many difficult scenes have been shot very perfectly, which feels really obvious. There are a few point of view shots which makes it more interesting. The characterizations given to each of the three lead characters justify them as good, bad and ugly. There are many moments which justify their characterizations. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach have done a complete justice to their roles. This movie, being set in the American Civil War, has some elements of it. However, it doesn't glorify the war and doesn't take any side. It portrays war as one of the worst things - just like in the way it should be. The war scenes are too damn good. Well choreographed and incredible cinematography. You can see a whole bunch of people engaging, and it obviously was not CGI. It wasn't really necessary to show all of that, but it did and it was great (Sergio Leone f**king rocks!). The violence does feel real and legit, in contrast to many older \"yuoppikaayaaayokaaiyaay\" Westerns. Last but the important thing would be music, Ennio Morricone's score is entirely of next level good. Incomprehensibly great. It complements every scene and either escalates the tension (eg. the final showdown) or just develops emotional and dramatic factors. Also, contrary to this, there are some moments of silence which serve similar purpose of escalating the tension and drama. The music is so good that even if you (somehow) end up not liking the film, you will definitely love the score by Morricone. It has absolutely no negatives whatsoever. It deserves every bit of praise it receives. .\n.\nConclusion : This is the Citizen f*cking Kane of Westerns. Every Western film (not necessarily Spaghetti) is compared with this. There is a reason why. This is a highly recommended film not only for Western lovers, but for every movie lover out there. As for me, I heard a lot of great things about it, then, I was ready to be disappointed, but I was blown away by it. It was way above my initial expectations, and delivered a lot more than that. Recently, only Infinity War managed to do so. It is a gem of a movie. .\n.\nRating. .\n.\nScore : absolute 10/10\nGrade : golden A+"

In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.\n\nI think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider \"spaghetti\" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the \"spaghetti\" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.\n\nIn such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.\n\nBut what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.\n\nCome on guys, let's face it. \"Spaghetti\" westerns are \"B\" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that. Sorry again."

I came into the movie knowing it was long, but was told it was worth it. That statement caused me to waste 3 hours of my life. Anyway, on to the reasons why it was a waste. The movie itself had a decent storyline. The problem with this movie, however, was that it is the longest, drawn out movie known to mankind. This movie could have been played out in literally 20 minutes based on what all happened in the movie. Instead, viewers get to wait 30 minutes while it shows Clint Eastwood crawl 20 feet through the sand not saying a word. Against my better judgment, I continue watching, waiting for something spectacular to happen in the end. As the end approaches, viewers get to wait through yet another drawn out scene, of 3 men standing in a triangle pointing guns at each other. After, 10 minutes of watching that, I lost interest of who was going to die anyway. It literally switches cameras more times than I can count. Then, the finale comes. That is when I comprehend just how much time had been lost in this movie. I am writing this review as a friendly favor to warn you of this lame excuse of a movie, because no one was there to warn me."

The Good the Bad and the Ugly is a classic of it's time and influential in the Western genre. However it is far from the best Western movie and is more suited to be watched on a airplane when people are about to vomit. It is overly long, overbearing and pretentious. The main character is cool looking but lacks the depth that other better protagonists have like Django Freeman from Django Unchained and Marquis Warren from The Hateful Eight. The Man with no Name is a flat, uninteresting, frivolous character who has the personalty of a run down car. The Man with no Name is more of a wizard with magic sharpshooting skills than an actually cowboy. Clint Eastwood is a sub par actor at best and his directing is good but he has yet to actually make a good script that would make his films a bit more tolerable.\nOh and if any old time critics or hardcore Eastwood fans got a problem with my review, they can shove their pompous opinions up their ass and **** somewhere else. Sometimes people say you have to watch a movie twice to get it but two hours and a half of boring bullcrap is enough for me.\nOpinions are subjective and that word is kryptonite for film critics.\nDjango Unchained is the best western of all time, so **** on that."

You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."

The movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen. The costumes, weapons, armor, props and movie sets are very well crafted. The landscapes and scenery of New Zealand are beautiful. Treebeard and the Ents are very well done in CGI. The ents are curiously wise and well spoken. The CGI incarnation of Gollum/Smeagol was incredibly emotive and powerful as it portrays Gollum as profoundly disturbing, amusing and almost lovable all at the same time. Hence, Gollum is still a CGI masterpiece. The special effects for the ents, the mumakil, the wargs, Sauron's eye and the fellbeast are very incredible. The filming locations and the movie sets for the Kingdom of Rohan look gorgeous. The Rohirrim are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost **** acting is superb with an amazing cast. Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Sir Christopher Lee as Saruman are flawless. Sean Astin was born for the role as Samwise Gamgee and portrays Sam's character perfectly. Andy Serkis gave an astonishing performance as Gollum. Elijah Wood Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin still make for a delightful duo. Viggo Mortensen's performance as Aragorn is visceral and sensitive with physical dexterity, along with being an empathic, warmer and fundamentally human in presence and charisma. Orlando Bloom still pulls of as Legolas very well. John Rhys-Davies is still brilliant and hilarious as Gimli. Bernard Hill gives a very perfect performance as King Theoden. Miranda Otto as Eowyn and Karl Urban as Eomer were excellent. David Wenham was a very good choice for the role as Faramir. Brad Douris gives a superb performance as Grima Wormtongue. The Battle of Helm's Deep is still one of the best movie battle scenes in cinema history. The scene where Haldir (Craig Parker) arrives with an army of Galadhirm elven warrirors at Helm's Deep to aid the men of Rohan is still one of highlights of The Two Towers movie. The action and fighting scenes at Helm's deep is epic and perfectly executed. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking. The downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breathtaking. The ents marching off to war and tearing down Isengard is still a very breathtaking and powerful moment. The scene where Gandalf and Eomer arrive with an army of Rohirrim, charging down a hill at the Uruk hai and turning the tide of battle at Helm's Deep is astonishing. Samwise Gamgee's \"some good things in the world worth fighting for\" speech to Frodo is very enlightening and provides positive motivation. The theme song for the kingdom of Rohan is very splendid. \"Gollum's Song\" by Emil\u00edana Torrini is a haunting beautiful and suspenseful song that plays at the movie credits. Peter Jackson's \"The Two Towers\" is one wonderful interpretation of the epic story. A spectacular adventure action experience.."

In this grand conflict between good and evil, the characters offer the audience a lot to cling onto as well. In this episode, Frodo and Sam continue their search for Moldor in order to destroy the ring, and they are using technology to follow Gollum, who is portrayed by Andy Serkis. We follow a few Hobbits and their tree companions, a few other fellowship members as they attempt to aid Gondor in fending off its foes, and the ascent of the wizard of Gondorf in a few of the side stories. The stories all flow together and have the same good against evil theme."

The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.\n\nWhen it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.\n\nThe acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.\n\nIn conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The second chapter introduces us with a roar as a divulged melee descends to water in the mines of Moria, when we believed that Gandalf was extinguished with the Balrog. The first film concludes with the Fellowship disintegrating on their own expedition to save Middle Earth and collide with a dilemma of their own. Frodo and Sam are resuming their hitchhike to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring and are confidentially leaving their footprints distinguishable to a creature on their heels, known as Smeagol, or preferably \u201cGollum.\u201d The exceptionally comprehended Sir Christopher Lee, who plays Gandalf\u2019s mirror image, Saruman is continuing to multiply an army of Orcs who continue to collapse tree after tree for space to create more cocoons of Orcs. As the imminent prisoners of Saruman, Merry and Pippin flee from a multitude of Orcs during their prosperous meal time in a multitude of Ents, whom they befriend and chat about their purposes throughout their portion of the film.\n\nOne of the few reasons why I like The Two Towers more than The Fellowship of the Ring is that the characters and stories are now acknowledged and we experience more exhilarating mobs of brawl sequences that take place in the last hour of this flick in Helm\u2019s Deep. With Gollum chaperoning the Hobbits to Mordor (wink wink), Sam begins to seek sins in Gollum\u2019s guts because of him letting the ring out of the bag and cries the name of its bearer and have pervasive contrasting influences. With Sam\u2019s suspicion and Gollum\u2019s diabolical and surreptitious intentions, a \u201cfriend vs foe\u201d for companion battle begins.\n\nAs the bridge chapter in Lord of the Rings, it unveils ways to create a positive army against the negative army, who is the only thing that is barricaded in the positives\u2019 road to Mordor. Although there is no beginning or end, The Two Towers has pacing that is more meticulous than what you might expect and is a recommendation at the tipping point. We also get more time shown in the colossal, yet glorious mountainous surfaces integrated from New Zealand to Middle Earth."

                    "review": "The final movie of the trilogy. I repeat myself: It is a good adaptation and really good movie. The books are full to the brim with stories, characters, lore and world building. It is a challenge to adapt these to the screen and I would have a hard time to do it. To clarify this: Not everything from a book can be adapted to a different medium and even with 3 long movies they have to make sacrifices. However this movie feels like they changed more from the source material than for the other two. What I deeply miss is a chapter near the end from \u201cThe Return of the King\u201d. There you can see how the 4 Hobbits have grown and the conclusion to Saruman and Wormtogue\u2019s story (Was added in the extended edition). Also the occurring problem between Sam and Frodo is absolute unbelievable for the readers of the book (But to be fair it is well done and enhances the movies story). Other than that I mind that they weakened Merry and Theoden\u2019s relationship, changed Eowyn\u2019s and Faramir\u2019s story and that the goodbyes and characters ever afters are not shown or changed. There are other changes and these might be harsher for others or hardcore fans. There are also some good additions: There are more character interactions between Sam, Frodo and Gollum, Faramir\u2019s attack with his men and the additions to Denethor to name a few. Story: This is the endgame. All characters are in a dire battle against Sauron\u2019s forces. Sam and Frodo try to sneak further into Mordor and stop Saruon forever. Aragon, Legolas and Gimli are rallying all help they can get for Gondor while Merry and Pippin fought their own battles. Gandalf is trying to keep everything together as Gondor\u2019s might will be put to a test and Rohan tries to get ass many warriors together to help them in its weakened state. Again the story works well. It is immersive, enjoyable and engaging. I repeat that they did not include a chapter that that shows the Hobbits way home and last struggle. It shows how much the 4 Hobbits had grown and even Gandalf said that they have become such great people that he does not need to worry about them or they even need him to solve issues. It the end I say it is good enough to get praised by me. Cast / Characters: I already praised the whole cast from the previous movies and repeat that nearly everyone became my definite interpretation. They nailed their roles and gave an awesome performance. For the new characters I fully praise John Noble as Denethor. An incredible performance. I think Lawrence Makoare as Witch King also deserves praise. With all these we got an awesome cast that fully delivers a great performance. Presentation: Also again New Zealand is such a beautiful location. It is no wonder that the movies raise the tourism by far. Atop on that all special effects look convincing and the sets and practical effects enhance the atmosphere too. I did not find a misstep here in this regard. Like for all previous movies we got an awesome soundtrack.  Overall this is a satisfying conclusion for an epic trilogy. Definitely a must see for movie fans. A worthy adaptation to a beloved book / books."

                    "review": "The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation.\n\nPercy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White.\n\nThe thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself.\n\nSpeaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you.\n\nAnd that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo.\n\nThe movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch.\n\nThe Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place."

There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books."

It follows Paul Atreides alongside the Fremen people in their fight against House Harkonnen.\n\nDune: Part One had criticisms of runtime and pacing, and even though Dune: Part Two tries to improve on these, the issues are still **** grandness of Dune is very evident. From the score to the cinematography to the world-building, this is a movie with ambition that seeks to thrill.\n\nThis sequel places greater emphasis on the story, yet even as Dune: Part Two reaches its conclusion, it's the journey itself that remains paramount.\nDune: Part Two explores several themes, prominently Fate versus Free Will. Paul Atreides grapples with the concept of his predetermined destiny as a messiah, attempting to resist it but eventually succumbing, despite foreseeing its detrimental consequences. The white saviour narrative is stoked and exposed for what it is; how charismatic leaders are ultimately dangerous. However, the film's deliberate ambiguity leaves the question of Fate versus Free Will unanswered by its conclusion.\n\nReligion plays a key role in Dune, it aids colonial control. Paul's mother skillfully manipulates the longstanding myth propagated by the Bene Gesserit to support her son. At first, Paul is very unreceptive but when he seeks revenge he plays into the myth.\n\nThemes of commerce and capitalism are also used in Dune. It's evident that these economic forces serve as the underlying catalysts for the issues depicted in the story (mirroring real-life colonial undertakings.)\n\nThe performances in Dune: Part Two are brilliant. Timothee Chalamet finally brings his range to Arrakis. The subtle changes he possesses in the course of the movie can only be done by a seasoned actor. Having gotten very little screen time in the first Dune, Zendaya shines as Chani in this sequel. She possesses a great level of expression control in the final act. Rebecca Ferguson delivers yet another captivating performance as always. This sequel brings a host of new cast members but Austin Butler and Florence Pugh stand out prominently. Austin brings a menacing and effective villainy to his portrayal of Feyd-Rautha, and is an absolute scene-stealer.\n\nDune: Part Two adequately builds and surpasses its predecessor. It solidly brings the ambition of the filmmaker to life. It is a visual treat that'll leave audiences hungry for the next instalment, Dune: Messiah.\n8/10"

There are a lot of characters on the screen, and boy, I think that most of the ideas in this film are not correctly truncated. The run time of this movie is practically 3 hours, My sister and I, who like long films, were agonizing for something more interesting to pop up or for the film to end. We still have 30 minutes to **** only thing that keeps you watching is how well the film is shot, with the different colour gradings, and camera angles, other than that, this film takes a lot from YOU GUESSED IT, STARWARS. Now am I saying that this is a bad film? No, It's just in my opinion not as focused as the first one. When this film needs to turn up to 11, it does, but it's those long in-between parts that make it satisfyingly unbearable. I think this is a 7/10 so far, I'll come back and re-rate the film when I'm done with it."

A story about foresight and the evil that could be perpetrated by otherwise good men who attain it. This is an incredibe movie both technically and in its storytelling. It made me truly believe that Paul was the leader Stilgar sees him as even though I know its all propaganda centuries in the making. But as he says in the movie his visions lead to ruin not because he loses control but because he gains it. The only criticism I have seems unavoidable when transiting dune from book to movie. Its alot. You have to do alot of research to even begin to truly appreciate Dune, while I dont mind having to do so I understand why some people find Dune to not properly explain itself when it comes to all its moving pieces. Still dont listen to anyone telling you this movie is bad or poorly made. It is simply the best Science Fiction movie weve had in decades and I think time will be extremely kind to it.

So for the second watch I went to an IMAX theater so that I could just enjoy it and I did. This movie is absolutely incredible. The cinematography is one of the best of all movies I'v seen. You feel like you're there on Arrakis, the characters feel real, their emotions feel real. The music is just incredibly cinematic. The visual effects are stunning. The sandworm-riding was the best part of the movie, it always looked more gorgeous each time we saw it. I cannot say the pacing is perfect, but it's certainly very good. During the first time watch I felt a little bored in the **** characters are all very interesting, my favourite being Stilgar of course, who probably deliveres all the jokes of the film. Javier Bardem is just amazing, but the best acting pefromance was given by Austin Butler. He was so intense. Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet was also really good. these two are probably going to be nominated for a lot of awards. But everyone was great, I especially love Stellan Skarsgard's Vladimir **** in all this movie is absolutely incredible, it's no question that it's a 10/10. Years later, when people look back on 2024, this film will probably come to their mind."

Per quanto riguarda i pregi questo film fa esattamente ci\u00f2 che un sequel dovrebbe fare, vale a dire incrementare la spettacolarit\u00e0, l'azione, l'epicit\u00e0 e la posta in gioco. Denis Villeneuve si riconferma essere uno dei pi\u00f9 autorevoli registi di questa generazione cinematografica, riuscendo a dare il giusto peso sia ai momenti di intimit\u00e0 e di quiete che ai momenti pi\u00f9 monumentali. Ogni singolo fotogramma del film potrebbe essere esposto in una galleria non soltanto per la sua fotografia ma anche per l'impeccabilit\u00e0 degli effetti visivi. E' per\u00f2 anche vero che la regia di Villeneuve pu\u00f2 risultare a tratti eccessivamente didascalica e accademica, senza la veracit\u00e0 e la visceralit\u00e0 che certe scene richiedono e raggiungendo degli spunti di sperimentazione in pochissimi momenti in tutto il film. Dal punto di vista narrativo il film \u00e8 spaccato a met\u00e0, nella misura in cui nella prima met\u00e0 si prende il giusto tempo (e forse anche troppo) a delineare la cultura del popolo dei Fremen toccando tematiche che lasciano lo spettatore con degli interessanti spunti di riflessione. Nella seconda met\u00e0 per\u00f2 il film subisce un'accelerazione ingiustificata degli eventi e dell'evoluzione dei ****, con un cambio di rotta repentino subito dal protagonista che diluisce completamente il suo tumulto interiore e la tridimensionalit\u00e0 della sua caratterizzazione. Allo stesso tempo molti altri **** sono criminalmente sacrificati a favore di modifiche rispetto alla storia narrata nel libro che, oltre ad essere ingiustificate, sono state dettate contemporaneamente dalla voglia di chiudere le vicende del primo capitolo della saga letteraria e dall'impossibilit\u00e0 di dare il giusto spazio agli avvenimenti pi\u00f9 importanti in un film di due ore e quarantacinque. Molte cose che erano state preannunciate nel primo capitolo non hanno la minima ripercussione in questo e allo stesso tempo viene ripetuto lo stesso identico errore, anticipando avvenimenti che verranno sviscerati chiss\u00e0 quando uscir\u00e0 il terzo capitolo. In buona sostanza si tratta di un film che, al netto dei suoi pregi e dei suoi difetti, \u00e8 alla pari del primo perch\u00e9 alcuni aspetti sono senz'altro migliorati ma altri che dovevano essere corretti vengono trascinati anche in questo e risultano dunque pi\u00f9 gravi ed inaccettabili."

Not to mention Chani isn't supposed to be black, so I do think Zendaya was a very poor casting for the role. \n\nI feel really bad for Princess Irulan's character given that she actually seems like an intelligent woman who would make a good wife for Paul but he's stuck on Chani who he has no chemistry with.

Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an  tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely."

Is there no one on set performing common sense checks against the screenplay?! What's the point of an epic story if two unprepared underdogs are going to simply defeat fearsome foes w/o breaking a sweat?! And then to become the new den mother, Jessica - from the Order of Benny and the Jets - has to drink what a minor character refers to as poison worm piss, and the woman giving it to her to drink says that she will die(!), and when she hesitates because of that they yell at her to drink - these kind of shenanigans are what you expect from a pledge party at a sorority! And then they realize, as it's discovered AFTER she drinks, she's pregnant! And this blue juice that that's toxic enough to knock her down, spaz out, and turn her eyes blue has no effect on her pregnancy! Really?! Really?! Again, what's the point of any of this if the protags are just going to magically coast through without any kind of sacrifice?! Then there's the gorgeous cinematography, yes, mounds and mounds of sand, and dank, dark caverns. If you're into shades of tan and brown, you're in heaven. And our co-star with the single name is deliberately made unattractive because that's just what an audience of mostly men want to see.

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

With a blend of breathtaking visuals and a profound narrative, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional **** in a not-so-distant future where Earth faces an existential crisis, \"Interstellar\" follows the journey of a team of astronauts led by Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) as they embark on a perilous mission through a newly discovered wormhole in search of a new habitable planet for humanity. Nolan's storytelling prowess shines as he navigates complex scientific concepts, weaving them into a compelling tale that tugs at the **** visuals in \"Interstellar\" are nothing short of mesmerizing. From the vastness of space to the intricate details of alien worlds, every frame is a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score elevates the emotional depth of the film, intensifying the viewers' connection to the characters and their plight.What truly sets \"Interstellar\" apart is its exploration of profound themes such as love, sacrifice, and the intrinsic curiosity that drives humanity's pursuit of the unknown. The film delves into the complexities of time dilation, relativity, and the human experience, inviting audiences to contemplate the mysteries of the universe and the resilience of the human spirit.While some might find the scientific concepts challenging to grasp, Nolan's dedication to authenticity and attention to detail add a layer of realism that enriches the overall experience. The ensemble cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, deliver stellar performances that anchor the emotional core of the story.\"Interstellar\" is a thought-provoking masterpiece that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. While it may require multiple viewings to fully absorb its depth, its impact is undeniable. I wholeheartedly give it a 9 out of 10, applauding Nolan's ambition and the film's ability to evoke wonder, contemplation, and a renewed appreciation for the vastness of both outer space and the human soul."

                    "review": "\"The Matrix,\" released in 1999, is widely considered to be one of the most influential and groundbreaking sci-fi films of the past 25 years. Directed by the Wachowskis, the film tells the story of Neo, a hacker who discovers that the reality he knows is actually a simulated world controlled by sentient machines. Keanu Reeves delivers a strong performance as Neo, and is supported by a talented cast including Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving. The film's unique blend of action, philosophy, and science fiction made it an instant classic, and its impact can still be felt in the genre today. The film also benefits from a memorable soundtrack and a standalone storyline that keeps the focus on the characters and their development. Despite the franchise's subsequent sequels not living up to the original, \"The Matrix\" remains a must-watch for any sci-fi fan.\n________________________\nMatrix, estrenada en 1999, es ampliamente considerada como una de las pel\u00edculas de ciencia ficci\u00f3n m\u00e1s influyentes e innovadoras de los \u00faltimos 25 a\u00f1os. Dirigida por los Wachowski, la pel\u00edcula cuenta la historia de Neo, un hacker que descubre que la realidad que conoce es en realidad un mundo simulado controlado por m\u00e1quinas inteligentes. Keanu Reeves ofrece una gran actuaci\u00f3n como Neo y cuenta con el apoyo de un elenco talentoso que incluye a Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne y Hugo Weaving. La combinaci\u00f3n \u00fanica de acci\u00f3n, filosof\u00eda y ciencia ficci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula la convirti\u00f3 en un cl\u00e1sico instant\u00e1neo, y su impacto a\u00fan se puede sentir en el g\u00e9nero en la actualidad. La pel\u00edcula tambi\u00e9n se beneficia de una banda sonora memorable y una historia independiente que mantiene el enfoque en los personajes y su desarrollo. A pesar de que las secuelas posteriores de la franquicia no est\u00e1n a la altura del original, \"The Matrix\" sigue siendo una visita obligada para cualquier fan\u00e1tico de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n."

What if you couldn't awaken? How would you know the difference between dream and reality? When a beautiful stranger (Carrie-Anne Moss) leads computer hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence. Neo joins legendary and dangerous rebel warrior Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) in the battle to destroy the illusion enslaving humanity.\n\nThe Directors: The Wachowski Brothers (Brothers Named Andy and Larry, Now Sisters Named Lilly and Lana) did really cool directing in this movie. He also directed the sequels including \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded (2003)\u201d, \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions (2003)\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix Resurrections (2021)\u201d\n\nThe Actors: there cool actors are Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Australia\u2019s Hugo Weaving did cool acting like iconic Characters.\n\nIt\u2019s a Live-Action Movie\n\nIt\u2019s got Action and Sci-Fi in it\n\nI enjoyed watching the movie when I was 9 but it\u2019s really cool\n\nI love this movie because it\u2019s got Cyberpunk style, kung-fu fight scenes and Shooting Sprees. My Favourite Character is Neo because he\u2019s really cool.\n\nThis is one of my Favourite movies of all time\n\nI give it 10/10"

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.\n\nParticularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.\n\nUse of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.\n\nAction is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.\n\nKeanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.\n\nSumming up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

            "review": "'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the \"stars\". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"

I have only seen 5 of his films, but 4 of them I have given 5 stars. This shows how good of a director he is and I soon want to watch more and more from him. Starting with the acting, it was brilliant. We meet lots of different characters, but at the centre we have Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This trio was brilliant, and had undeniable chemistry. Pesci steals the show as this hotheaded gangster who is so threatening, funny and scary. The scene of him saying \u2018why am I funny\u2019 was genuine perfection from Pesci. Next, Liotta leads the film as Henry Hill. He is at first out of place, and really building into this society, but soon, he is the one calling the shots and put under pressure himself. We also have Robert De Niro, who is amazing as the mentor to Liotta, who guides him through the film. The whole of the ensemble is good beyond these three, and there may even be too many characters, but the film knows only to focus on the important ones.Scorsese is amazing and every element of what he does is purposeful. He uses a monologue throughout from Henry Hill and his wife to really guide us through the film. A monologue can be annoying, but when done in the way Scorsese does it, it works amazingly. He let the important moments play out, but the build up works even better with pauses, and just hearing how it is going. Beyond that, Scorsese is the gangster king. He really understands what makes these films works and really focuses on that. He makes every single scene engaging, and the film has the structure that was done even better by the Wolf of Wall Street, the rise and fall structure. There is tension like the Departed, and Scorsese just knows the **** story is amazing. We of course have the rise and fall structure, and the scenes done in such an engaging way. The dialogue is amazing, particularly between the three main characters of the film. The film manages to communicate a lot, but it doesn\u2019t once get overwhelming. There is a lot to be said, for how well the film works in delivering everything it wants to do. The ending was also really **** technical elements really worked. We of course have the sound and score playing the background songs like in every Scorsese film, and that really brings a heartbeat to the film. We also have the amazing cinematography, which is great because of all the lighting, which demonstrates the evil in these characters. The editing was great, and the pacing just works. It isn\u2019t that fast paced, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me. It just works for me.Overall, an amazing film from Scorsese that shows his prowess. The cast is amazing, and the story is great. This is a mob classic, and instantly one of my favourite films.RelatedScorsese RankingSamuel L.

                    "review": "Goodfellas: A Real-Life Drama Unveiling an Engrossing Tale Beyond Fiction - The Apex of Cinematic Excellence\"\nAs a lifelong movie buff, I have journeyed through tales woven by cinematic geniuses, from Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" to Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" and David Fincher's \"Fight Club.\" Each of these narratives, while grounded in audacious fiction, left indelible marks on my cinematic memory. But none could quite surpass the experience offered by Martin Scorsese's magnum opus, \"Goodfellas.\" A testament to the adage that fact can be stranger than fiction, Goodfellas not only mesmerized me but also reshaped my understanding of the power of storytelling.\n\nWhile Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" is hailed as the greatest film of all time, for me, \"Goodfellas\" ascends a step further. Beyond just being a film, it's an immersive experience, creating a world so compelling that one doesn't simply watch, but rather, becomes a part of it.\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is no mere movie. It is a high-octane ride through the treacherous, yet intoxicating underbelly of the mafia. Scorsese adapts Nicholas Pileggi's novel, \"Wiseguy,\" to present a gripping narrative rooted in reality, thus proving that a true story, when well-told, can be as, if not more, captivating than fictional works.\n\nThe dialogues of the film are a tour de force - memorable, impactful, and infinitely quotable. They're a powerful testament to Scorsese's skillful storytelling, etching themselves into your memory and sparking conversation years after you've left the cinema.\n\nThe cinematography is nothing short of masterful. Each shot, each angle, each frame serves a purpose, painting a vivid picture of a world not many of us know, but are nevertheless intrigued by. Scorsese takes you on a visual journey that's as captivating as it is unsettling.\n\nAt the heart of \"Goodfellas\" is Joe Pesci's electrifying performance as Tommy DeVito, for which he earned a well-deserved Oscar. His ten-second acceptance speech at the Academy Awards stands as a symbol of his raw and pure talent - no frills needed. Pesci's portrayal of DeVito is arguably one of the greatest performances in film history, embodying a character so complex and volatile, it's impossible to look away.\n\nThe pacing of \"Goodfellas\" is a masterclass in filmmaking. There's never a dull moment as Scorsese expertly navigates through decades of organized crime, maintaining the narrative tension throughout. The movie flows like a torrential river, carrying its audience through a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nComplementing the visuals and narrative is the incredible soundtrack that pulsates through every scene, enhancing the emotional landscape of the characters. From the adrenaline rush of the criminal high life to the unnerving paranoia induced by overindulgence in drugs, the music adds a layer of authenticity that amplifies the cinematic experience.\n\n\"Goodfellas,\" in essence, is a cinematic tour de force, a triumph in storytelling that pushes the boundaries of film, and the #1 movie in my list. Its influence stretches far, inspiring masterpieces such as \"The Sopranos.\" Yet, it stands tall in its uniqueness, a beacon of filmmaking that reminds us why we fall in love with movies."

The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning.

Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta.

Reflect on whose words we listen to and tend to accept. This is an important question in the context of a film that asks us to consider gangsters as notable human beings. Henry Hill, the narrator and the main character of the film, seems to be in the role of our guide.\nHe talks to us throughout the film (using Voice Over) and what we see as the viewer is actually what he sees and the story seems to be controlled by him as the main character. As Scorsese constantly questions the fact whether humans have control over things or it is the circumstances and the story that happen to humans. This is one of the recurring themes and an important part of the main structure in this good director's films. The use of a omniscient (narrator) who is also the main character of the film in each of the films has made the viewer feel inside the story."

Several of Scorsese's efforts are considerable works of art themselves (Taxi Driver chief among these \"other\" efforts), but with GoodFellas the director achieves a platonic balance - the film is stylish and enjoyable while also being gritty and disorienting. There is violence, profanity and moral darkness, yet the experience goes down smoothly and enjoyably. Few directors can make the sinister and even the brutally horrific seem palatable, or even alluring in the way Scorsese can. The performances, in particular by Joe Pesci as the hotheaded Tommy, are uniformly wonderful, with each actor perfectly suited to their parts. The cinematography is similarly peerless, while the accompanying soundtrack makes for the perfect background for the unrelenting narrative. Very few films truly deserve the title of \"masterpiece,\" but this deathlessly popular and deservedly well-respected saga is as worthy as any film made of such a label; it serves as a potent reminder that, when in the hands of an artist who truly understands his craft and is able to forge an empathic link to their audience, film can be a transcendent and ravishing medium where art can gracefully meet commerce. GoodFellas is a modern, big budget picture with the verve of an old Hollywood studio classic mixed with the insight and craft of an arthouse staple. It's not to be missed."

I had a tendency to constantly compare it to other mafia movies and I kept comparing it to The Godfather. At the time, although I thought Mafiosi was a great film, it was overshadowed by The Godfather for me. So I watched Mafians again a few years later and liked the movie much, much more. Awesome story and especially made even better by the fact that it was based on a true story. In some ways even a more interesting story than the aforementioned Godfather. 2 hours and 20 minutes went by pretty damn fast. I was absolutely immersed in the plot. Without a doubt one of the best mafia movies of all time. Excellent. As a fan of the mafia theme, I'm absolutely enchanted. Robert De Niro is great, as always. I'm glad I gave this film a second chance."

Como \u00e9 de costume nas suas obras, o realismo aqui atingido \u00e9 assustador em alguns momentos. O anti-romantismo aqui funciona bem. Fica bem claro que os personagens s\u00e3o psic\u00f3ticos e corrompidos, e se voc\u00ea se deixa influenciar por eles, o problema est\u00e1 na sua cabe\u00e7a.\n\nA paranoia e a realidade luxuosa, \"privilegiada\", crua e imprevis\u00edvel \u00e9 muito bem retratada aqui. Isso nos deixa nervosos, pois sabemos que qualquer coisa pode acontecer, e a ci\u00eancia do protagonista n\u00e3o melhora muito as coisas, afinal ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 no controle.\n\nFoi muito interessante ver a atua\u00e7\u00e3o explosiva e psic\u00f3tica do Joe Pesci ap\u00f3s assisti-lo em \"O Irland\u00eas\", onde ele ocupa um papel bem diferente na mafia. Posso dizer o mesmo de Robert De Niro, que nesse filme da vida a uma pessoa mais temperamental, se comparada ao seu pape no filme aqui j\u00e1 mencionado. Lorraine Bracco estava excelente, e me fez sentir raiva da personagem dela as vezes, de t\u00e3o  bem que ela interpretava nos momentos de puro del\u00edrio.\n\nGoodfellas \u00e9 um filme essencial para quem \u00e9 fan do g\u00eanero e se considera um cin\u00e9filo. Al\u00e9m do enredo, o casting \u00e9 lend\u00e1rio e a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do Scorsese sempre \u00e9 uma maravilha de se apreciar."

The director named Scorsese has gone on to make many movies including Casino which may follow on from Goodfellas but that may be highly controversial and I may be wrong. Casino has some of the same actors like De Niro and Pesci and the same director so it's similar to Goodfellas and so how it was made too. ..... The main actor in Goodfellas is a guy named quite politely Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, other characters are Jimmy Conway played by Robert De Niro and whatever Pesci's character was called, Tommy I think. The film revolves mainly around violence and family issues aswell as a few gangster scenes, a scene where an old friend insults Tommy (Joe Pesci) at a bar, says sorry and Tommy comes back later and with his friend Jimmy Conway (De Niro) beats the **** out of him on the floor after he insulted Tommy to the point where he's a bloody mess then dump him in the boot of a car then later stab him is genuinely one of the best scenes in this movie. There are many well made violent scenes but there's a few problems with Goodfellas and one is Lorraine Bracco who plays Henry Hill's wife because all she does is moan, cry, whinge, shout, yell and be absolutely annoying and you just want to knock her out. The other problem is that Goodfellas centres too much around family involvement and family issues which makes the film more boring than is necessary for a 18 rated violent movie, some of the characters are silly and even unlikeable. I thought drug use in the movie was a good idea but being mainly centred around family and family issues weakened it for me and having kids and babies star in an adult, graphic violent movie shot the director in the leg on this masterpiece. It just didn't work and Lorraine Bracco is unlikeable as Henry Hill's wife and even Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a bit dull or over the top at times. Joe Pesci was excellent in Goodfellas, Robert De Niro could of been much better but the violent scenes were good with plenty of blood. However mostly I found Goodfellas to be boring, bit too long with annoying Lorraine Bracco in it which is just absolute torture to sit through and experience and that annoying kid at the beginning of the movie who played a young Henry Hill putting petrol or gasoline over cars and setting them alight so all the cars explode into a ball of fire then running away was totally unnecessary. Mostly a bland, dull, boring movie with some annoying characters, some good characters, some horrible songs played throughout the film, some good violent scenes but nothing special and a bit gloomy.... Could of been much better a film."

I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10."

It is one of those difficult films that manages to create entertainment, drama, and heartfelt tragedy between its unforgettable characters as they are all cooped up in one hellish spot. As you can guess, a big reason why these characters are unforgettable is because of the actors who portray them.

Good job on Jack Nicholson and Scattman Crothers for being in both, by the way. The beauty in its direction, the sometimes beautiful, but sometimes chilling score, and the absolutely mind blowing performances, they all mix together like the spices in a  good meal. It's fantastic. Jack Nicholson plays the raunchy, but somewhat likeable lead with biting wit and later crushing sentimentality. His other inmates, played by the likes of Danny Devito and Christopher Lee, are all fascinating characters in their own right, that you only get to scratch the surface of. And, of course, the oscar winning performance of Louise Fletcher as the chilling, but relatable nurse, who truly believes she is helping the men she keeps captive, is one of the best performances I have ever witnessed. The immense beauty in its finale, the biting relationship between McMurphy and Bramden, the hilarious actions that he does to prove his insanity, his slow decent into madness, the soul crushing emotional climax just before the end, it's too much to comprehend. I can not describe how utterly and truly shocked I was after watching this movie. It is one of the greatest pieces of art ever made, a rare occasion where everything from the casting to the writing was so pitch-perfect it felt as if the stars had aligned just for this masterpiece to exist. If you have not seen this movie, you are missing one of the seventies' greatest films. Watch it if you have ay self respect as a movie watcher."

The most evident conflict throughout One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is that between Ratched and McMurphy. They are natural antagonists. She's a strait-laced, by the book individual and he's a freespirit and rule breaker who pushes the envelope at every opportunity. For much of the film, they probe one another, each winning minor skirmishes. As the narrative accelerates toward its conclusion, McMurphy risks all in a final gambit. When he loses, we know it's over for him. For all that she is the film's villain, Ratched is not inherently malevolent. She's cool and unemotional, but she believes what she is doing is for the betterment of the patients. She's one of those individuals who does bad things while thinking she's doing good. That makes her more complex and interesting than a character who represents evil incarnate.(Relevant film with relevant themes)."

To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.\n\nDirected by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.\n\nTouching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture."

                    "review": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it\u2019s message that it remains a classic film of the 1970\u2019s. One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.\r\nMany films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society\u2019s rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It\u2019s both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.\r\nThe most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it\u2019s own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it\u2019s humor is occasionally a little crude, but it\u2019s the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.\r\nThe movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.\r\nIn conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it\u2019s message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system\u2019s ineptitude. It\u2019s also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it\u2019s just in general a great film."

McMurphy's fate, presented in such an uncompromising manner, is like a punch to the gut, and the last true act of friendship shown to him by Chief brings a tear to the eye. The final scene is meant to be cathartic, but it doesn't seem that way. Although it's accurate to say that freedom has been attained by both Chief and McMurphy (albeit in different ways), it's hard to see the conclusion as anything but a cloud with a silver lining. For a film that is inspiring and upbeat for most of its running length, this change in tone leaves the viewer disoriented.\r\n\r\nKen Kesey, who wrote the book upon which the 1963 Broadway play and the subsequent movie were based, was displeased with the screenplay credited to Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben (Milos Forman also had a hand in writing it).

An outstanding performance from Jack Nicholson, whom I believe to be the best actor to have lived, is accompanied by amazing performances from Sydney Lassick, Christoper Lloyd, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher. This film is relate-able to so many people, as it delves into human nature and kindness between one another; forgetting that the majority of the characters we see suffer from severe mental disabilities. From the moment you see Jack Nicholson walk on screen you're hooked (his acting was just spot on), and the director creates an environment, that against all odds feels as if you can become completely immersed and a part of.\r\n10/10 Absolutely brilliant film that will go down as a all time classic."

We experience the asylum through the eyes of McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he arrives there and gets into the routine. Some suspect that he is faking his insanity to get out of a jail sentence.\r\n\r\nThis debate is never really explored in the movie. He may have been a little unorthodox but surely enough he is sane most of the time, except for the occasional rips in the exterior when we can't really be sure, like when he claims to be able to lift a certain heavy object and use it to make his escape. And he does not seem to be especially concerned about being thrown between people who are clearly more disturbed in their minds. He only loses his cool when he is being repeatedly pestered, which I think most people would. He feels constrained by authority and almost immediately after coming to the facility attempts to meddle with the schedule set in place for the patients. On several occasions he disregards rules and regulations entirely and creates serious trouble for the institution. Occasionally we delve into the lives of some of the other patients and learn about their experiences before they were committed.\r\n\r\nNicholson delivers a once in a lifetime performance. McMurphy is so full of life that you can't help but be drawn to him. The plot takes you to wherever Mac decides to take us, and it is a ride of wonder. The secondary characters were well realized and quite fun to watch. The interactions between them were the source of much of the humour in the movie.\r\n\r\nSome treatments allegedly used for the benefit of the patients are also highlighted, like Electroconvulsive therapy and Lobotomy. The way the staff keeps control over the patients has the same underlying threat of force or punishment to keep them in line just like in a prison.\r\n\r\nTowards the end, McMurphy sacrifices his own interests to show his friends what life is like on the outside. By embracing the joys of life, he embodies its values more than the ones who claim to be assisting the people in this madhouse.\r\n\r\nI always wondered how people went mad, and why so few came back to sanity. Though it may present a dramatized version of it, it was moving when it came. And the fact that 'normal' people expected 'mad' people to behave in a certain way, and maybe even welcomed it, is perhaps the reason when somewhat disturbed people when admitted into institutions only deteriorate as they conform to the commonly accepted view. Perhaps a bit of understanding and love may be the key to make the disturbed people believe that they are indeed wanted and should make an effort to resolve their unresolved issues, and be more resolute and assertive about their needs.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the kind of movie to depend on cinematography and score. It's very simple and straightforward. Sometimes having glitter only ruins the effect, and I'm glad that's not how the movie was made. The focus was on acting, directing and screenplay. When these departments are well looked after, you can have a good decent movie without the need of an especially big budget.\r\n\r\nNot many movies would be able to achieve the same sense of belonging one could feel for with people declared clinically insane, and I feel like it speaks for the strength of the director, Milas Forman, who has a knack for portraying out of the ordinary individuals in situations that are themselves quite extraordinary."

What\u2019s more impressive, it achieved another grand slam in all 5 major Oscar categories.\r\n\r\nBasically the film is confined inside a mental institution, among a breed of patients, a newcomer McMurphy\u2019s arrival stirs Nurse Ratched\u2019s tyranny, whose strategy of manipulating those deranged is to coerce them into retread their horrible past and force them suffer under the name of group therapy, such a detestable character, Louise Fletcher nailed it, a borderline leading role, Fletcher\u2019s Oscar victory may raise some controversy, but her performance is impeccable in accentuating a devilish incarnation of obstinacy and ruthlessness. Nicholson won his first Oscar in his heyday, as McMurphy, a petty criminal has a sane mind, threatens the authorities as a black sheep in the group, whose devil-may-care boldness and utter naivety (assuming that the institution is a much better place than a prisoners\u2019 reforming farm) conflicts in the process of his freedom-seeking and his direct influence on other real mentally-impaired ward mates, ultimately, his tragedy is a boomerang to his gullibility and self-considered kindness, which squanders his best shot of escape and obliquely preconditions Billy\u2019s final breakdown. The ambivalence of McMurphy\u2019s heroic recklessness is the most intriguing topic of the film, he is not an amiable fellow, a ruffian on the street with a rebellious attitude, it is not in his intention to ameliorate his fellow mates\u2019 condition, his presence does not have an initiative motivation, what he does is his knee-jerking response of a living soul who hankers for an unsubdued environment which the society refuses to proffer.\r\n\r\nThere are many political allusions can be extracted from the film, to which I shall not refer  since I am no American and am unfamiliar with the history, but the film garners a great amount of impressive supporting performances, Dourif\u2019s big screen debut is stutteringly poignant, whose demise is a facile move in heightening the tension, but performance-wise, it is more awe-inspiring than the two leads aforementioned. Sampson, as the Chief, symbolizes the hope of the unsuppressed, his backstory is curtailed and his pretense has never been given a chance to be expounded. Two old-hand actors are surprisingly seen in this film when in their youth, a tough Lloyd and a meek DeVito, and many deceased names also, Crothers, Redfield and Lassick, the latter is another show-stealer, over-the-top but strikingly hilarious.\r\n\r\nForman\u2019s preference over classical music also reflects in the film, the opening score from Jack Nitzsche hums along with a melancholic tone and the symphony-driven pieces are inserted into the right place at the right time. There are many memorable shots, e.g.  Nicholson being electric-shocked and Fletcher being strangled are too authentic to stare, on the whole ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO\u2019S NEST is a sound accusation towards high-handed suppression and dominance, its sociological impact even rises above over the film\u2019s own integrity **** made with excellent cast and wry irony."

The genius if RP McMurphy is the performance of Nicholson, we never quite know if this man is insane, thus ending up at the mental institution, or if his cunning wit but also lazy nature has brought him here.\r\nBut of course, there is quite the proverbial thorn in the side of our anti-hero, in the form of Nurse Ratched, a calculated and frightening care worker within the walls if the institute who is brought to life in eerily silent fashion by Louise Fletcher, her focused and condescending persona against the live wire and rambling Nicholson is a perfect light and dark or good vs evil-type set-up.\r\nThe undeniable highlights of the film are interactions McMurphy has with his fellow patients including Cheswick, Martini and of course Chief, the silent giant. From these characters it is clear that the intentions of McMurphy become somewhat unclear, is he around just to mess with their heads or is he trying to help them? But the interactions and confrontations that happen between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchet are uniquely cold, still and disturbing. The purpose unclear, but the entertainment in full swing.\r\nThe flawed moments lie in the arc of the story. The comedy, while enjoyable, also overlaps with the very serious nature of the film, which can sometimes create a blurred line as to what we should and shouldn't be amused about, but perhaps this was the intention, for reaction and criticism purposes.\r\nThe performances alone are enough to grant this masterful status, but the blend of sombre techniques and a varied score of heartwarming and heartbreaking demeanour has made it unique in every possible way, from the setting to the situations.\r\nOne of the most quotable and memorable films you will watch, with its superb characters who go above and beyond in their roles to encapsulate their characters, it truly is a great sense of wonder."

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a beautifully written/directed piece of cinema with one of greatest ensemble casts you are ever likely to witness. Louise Fletcher, for me, steals the show with her seemingly effortless attempt at playing the twisted, manipulative character that is Nurse Ratched. Her performance is undoubtedly flawless and that's not to mention the lead role of R.P McMurphy, played by the legendary Jack Nicholson who, like the rest of the cast, puts on an almighty show. Arguably, the scene that guaranteed the Oscar win for Best Picture is the scene where Billy is caught by Nurse Ratched in the morning. The use of silence here is impeccable  and really puts us in the centre of the situation with the other patients who loom helplessly in the background watching the drama unfold. It's certainly no surprise that OFOTCN is one of only three films to have ever won the famous \"Oscar Grand slam\", winning Best Lead Actor, Best Lead Actress, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The reasoning behind this is that the film is immaculate in every way possible and one that will most likely never be emulated."

            "reviewer": "antonjsw1Sep 12, 2010",
            "review": "Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on\u2013set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."

This is intense **** biggest change is the characters filled more developed and deep now which isn't improvement and even if it is a more serious movie it is still has time for silly silly stuff like a little green dwarf on your back who teaches  magic  just that kind of silliness that  bring it together,The last part of the movie is just so intense and you're wondering for the characters that they feel in danger and the movie ends on the best cliffhang I have seen in the **** most impressed by was Luke Skywalker and yodas training because it was just the right amount of silliness and fun, but it was also in meditative it felt like he was learning something but he had too much  pressure to sit **** thing to say is that this movie is the perfect merchant between silly and serious movie making and  the classic it is today."

And when I heard that the Tel Aviv Cinematheque was doing this event, of screening the films of the original trilogy one after the other, I realized that I had to be at least at the screening of the Empire. There's no way I'm going to miss an opportunity to see this movie for the first time on a big screen. Wow, what an experience that was. First of all, I didn't expect it, but the hall was full of fanatical fans who clapped and cried with excitement at every nonsense, and it warmed my heart, made me cry myself, and upgraded the viewing experience about 1000 times. This film was and remains a temporary masterpiece in everything to do with building characters and the processes they go through, brilliant villain construction, set and scenery design, effects, cinematography, editing, use of colors, everything here is simply above any other film I've seen. And you can still discover something new here every time you watch it again. The real narrative ark of this movie, with all due respect to Luke and his father, is the Millennium Falcon - the whole movie is building for us this moment of the transition to the lightspeed. The whole movie they try - and fail. Something in the first movie in the series was obvious, and once it happens - it's so satisfying, because for two hours you watched a movie whose entire purpose was to struggle to do something they did easily in the first movie. Princess Leia, for example, is always lit in a bright, washed-out white light, due to her being a princess. So many meanings, wisdom, precise and sophisticated cinematic expression. A film that was ahead of its time, that you are easily drawn into and cannot get back out of, and most importantly - show me another film that is able to fill a cinema theater like this today, more than 40 years after it was released. Masterpiece, Masterpiece, Masterpiece!"

The impact of some of the special effects may have been diminished because they were essentially the same as those in Episode IV, making this movie slightly weaker than the first. In the previous movie, they were unique, but in this one, they were expected. Still, a superb movie. This entire series is set to go down in history as \"Classic,\" etc. People, in my opinion, had great expectations going into this movie and weren't let down. I wasn't, actually; the movie is excellent. Still, like I mentioned, only a SLIGHTLY less impressive than the first."

The music is thematic to each character or circumstance which proves to create a specific tone depending on the characters that are seen on screen, and though risk is amplified and deception is introduced to further texturize the unique Skywalker story, the aggressive use of dated special effects creates a distraction more so than an escape. Where \"A New Hope\" stands strongly as a solo film, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is distinctly positioned as a bridge between the introduction and conclusion of this three-part saga which provides an array of moving parts with nearly no resolution. The film is incredibly exciting because of the amount of turbulence these characters face collectively and individually, but without the technology or staging process to propel audiences deep into the **** of space (which is where most of this film takes place) an argument could be made that this vision was truly ahead of its time. A reputable expansion of the events from the first film that simultaneously withholds the expansion of these characters and everything that made them interesting to begin with."

Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"

His innocence throughout the film creates more dread for the viewers as they await his execution, hoping their will be a narrow escape from it. I find it obscure that Coffey might possess the power of God with his mysterious healing powers, nonetheless, it furthers the kindness and love of this friendly giant. Fabulous acting, as I always long to see. It is an emotional roller coaster for both the audience and characters. This is three straight hours of masterful filmmaking at its best."

My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.\n\nThe film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).\n\nThe script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clich\u00e9d and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.\n\nOverall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

What made me even question this is I am watching the series in John Wayne Gacy the Killer Clown. And one of the victims child asked why did it take so long and there was supposedly some cops involved in the 33 crimes. So I started to think about The Green Mile and **** this movie showing us that they did fake executions? You know movies reveal alot of things. Well you all ask what do I mean. Well the part when they were practicing the execution and they had the inmate acting like he was getting electrocuted. Well for one why wpuld they do that? With a inmate anyways. Why didnt they just do it with another officer? I believe they actually did stuff like that to fake executions on sime people. Because you know they put people out there to do things like this. I mean murder people and stuff. This is an evil world. How hard wpuld it be to fake an execution really? And they never let the public see ****? Someone with a depth of intellect please dialogue with me on this. Thanks."

Too bad for Metacritic that this landmark movie received such a meager metascore mostly due to some preposterously low ratings by some of the critics. Must see movie, one of the very best ever made, right up there with Saving Private Ryan, The Silence of the Lambs and The Fellowship of the Ring. At least the users know a great movie when they see one."

Anyways this movie is so **** great, its got its philosophy super tight, its got an amazing cast with suchn great performances. Darabont knows how to immerse his viewers just like King to his readers it has a strong view on prejudice at least in my opinion. The movie from top to bottom is such a great watch not a dull moment and moments from small to big impact the story in many ways I highly recommend this movie. Also its 3 hours long not many movies can handle such a big time frame and maintain their viewers like this one has."

This is a terrific, emotional film that you never want to stop watching. If there is a negative review out there that addresses a fault present in the picture, I have not seen it."

It was in prison that he met John Coffey, a black giant accused of murder, but that seems able to do incredible things and have a kindness beyond doubt. Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on a Stephen King novel, it features Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the lead roles.\n\nThis film is proof that, even in Hollywood, film art still finds a room. In fact, it's one of the most beautiful and human films made by the industry in recent decades and deals with controversial issues such as the impartiality of the justice and prison system, questionableness of capital punishment and the human right to a truly fair trial. The script is above reproach and it truly lives up to King's book. The cast surpassed in quality, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan, an actor who still isn't very famous outside the U.S. but that made a deep and moving role. Tom Hanks was also good but it wasn't unexpected because he had shone in recent films like \"Philadelphia\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\", launched one or two years before this.\n\nAddress controversial issues in an original and impactive way is often synonymous with success in cinema. Personally, I consider this film as one of the finest ever made in U.S. over the past decades. The film speaks for itself and that's enough to understand why I think so."

Quite involving at its best and needlessly attenuated and self-consciously \"inspiring\" at its worst, pic has all the earmarks of a year-end prestige release, beginning with Tom Hanks at the top of a fine cast.\r\n\r\nWorking from King\u2019s 1996 bestseller that was published in six serialized paperback installments, Darabont is nothing if not a fastidious storyteller dedicated to fulsome character detailing and sturdy structural carpentry.\r\n\r\nIn this new film, as in \u201cShawshank,\u201d the writer-director proves very adept at lighting numerous long fuses that burn slowly through the yarn\u2019s lengthy telling and finally pay off in some big moments, some more satisfying than others.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tribute to Darabont\u2019s skill that he is able to sustain interest in these strands over such a long haul; it\u2019s a reflection of his self-indulgence that he should think that this material warrants such doting elaboration.\r\n\r\nTold as an epic flashback by a very elderly man who relates his long-secret story to a lady friend at a nursing home, tale is largely set within the modest confines of E block, or death row, at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Louisiana in 1935.\r\n\r\nTitle refers to the shade of the faded linoleum on the floor of the facility, a well-kept bright brick building that resembles a small warehouse.\r\n\r\nPresiding over the handful of inmates is head guard Paul Edgecomb (Hanks), a decent middle-aged man dedicated to maintaining as much calm and dignity as possible, given the dire circumstances of his prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn his staff are his loyal second-in-command, Brutus \u201cBrutal\u201d Howell (David Morse); sensitive greenhorn Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper); old pro Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn); and the group\u2019s wild card, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), a shrimpy sadist who can get away with all manner of horrible behavior since he\u2019s the son of the governor\u2019s wife.\r\n\r\nBehind bars at the outset are good-hearted Creole Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and repentant Native American murderer Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene), who\u2019s about to walk the mile to the electric chair.\r\n\r\nShortly joining them, and barely able to fit into his cell, is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a towering, heavily muscled black man who\u2019s been convicted of killing two little girls. Belying Coffey\u2019s menacing look, however, is his demeanor, which is unvaryingly sweet-natured, polite and openly vulnerable; the greatest concern of this illiterate, childlike giant is that some lights be left on at night since he\u2019s afraid of the dark.\r\n\r\nTypical of Darabont\u2019s deliberate approach is the detail with which he presents the rehearsal for the Indian\u2019s execution. A morbidly tense and riveting sequence reveals a startlingly makeshift-looking electric chair and what it takes to successfully put a prisoner to death.\r\n\r\nSo, between the opposite poles of good and evil repped by the saintly simpleton Coffey on the one hand and the maniacal Wharton and Percy on the other, Darabont begins heavily developing thoughts about the extremes of which human beings are capable, as represented by their ability to give life and take it away.\r\n\r\nWhile \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d often grabs, and generally holds, one\u2019s attention through the long journey, there are any number of sequences that could have been tightened or eliminated in the interests of storytelling dispatch. Darabont\u2019s technique readily sustains the thoroughness with which he develops scenes, but his points would still be clear enough without the epic treatment.\r\n\r\nAnd while Hutchison and Rockwell create deliciously hateable figures of pure evil, and Duncan elicits appropriately massive sympathy with his pivotal performance as the agent of goodness, these characters never grow multi-dimensionally and are ultimately more symbolic than credibly real.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the ensemble acting is of a high order. Hanks excels as the prison guard who is well balanced enough to nearly always handle his many troubles in proper, imaginative fashion.\r\n\r\nAlong with Duncan, all the other actors playing doomed inmates get their big moments to shine, with Jeter blending courage with emotional fragility as Delacroix.\r\n\r\nPercy aside, the prison officials are all portrayed as fundamentally upstanding. Gary Sinise is commanding in his one scene as an attorney who gives his views on Coffey to Edgecomb.\r\n\r\nWithin individual scenes, Richard Francis-Bruce\u2019s editing is impeccably precise in obtaining maximum values, while Thomas Newman\u2019s generally strong score occasionally slips over-stressed grandeur."

The guards (including Tom Hanks) are very wary of him at first, but find him a kind, loving man.  How could he have committed murder?  And he seems to be able to cure illness and bring a dead mouse back to life.  How can this be?  He introduces himself as James Coffee, J.C., Jesus Christ?  So, do we crucify him again?  Would we recognize the second coming of Christ if he was a huge black man?  What if he was a woman?  I don't have a lot of DVDs but this one is in my collection."

I have never seen a movie made with skill such as what can be found in The Green Mile. Most of this movie is just tuning in on these prison guards lives at their jobs and it is never at any point boring throughout the 3hour runtime. Stephen King wrote this book brilliantly and Frank Darabont brought it to the big screen brilliantly. Every single character in this movie is memorable and amazing. You will never hate someone as much as you will hate Percy, my personal favorite character form the movie. He was done so perfectly that it makes me feel bad for the actor because I might accidentally hit him if I ever see him in real life purely by instinct. *semi spoiler (but not really)* The other antagonist is also highly hateable. All the protagonist are very likable. The story is beautiful but might be difficult to swallow for people with certain religious beliefs. This is a must see, just don't watch it when you are sad and need a happy tale or comedy because this movie is full of tragedy."

The story in itself is heartbreaking and gut wrenching, so grab your tissues, but by the end of it don't be surprised if you want to watch the entire thing all over again. Tom Hanks is absolutely fabulous in the role of Paul Edgecomb, and the performances by Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and Sam Rockwell add all the necessary depth to their characters. Thrilling, magical, funny, traumatising... The Green Mile is all those things and I believe it would be impossible to be bored by this film. It's another one that requires your undivided attention and it is quite long but it doesn't feel that way by the end. There are characters you will love and ones you will hate but you will be touched by the stories they tell. I am always blown away by this movie, it is one of my all time favourites, and I highly recommend it."

                    "review": "\"We think of this place like an intensive care ward of a hospital.\" So says Paul Edgecomb, who is in charge of Death Row in a Louisiana penitentiary during the Depression. Paul (Tom Hanks) is a nice man, probably nicer than your average Louisiana Death Row guard, and his staff is competent and humane--all except for the loathsome Percy, whose aunt is married to the governor, and who could have any state job he wants, but likes it here because \"he wants to see one cook up close.\" One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (\"like the drink, only not spelled the same\"), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of.\r\n\r\n\"The Green Mile\" (so-called because this Death Row has a green floor) is based on a novel by Stephen King, and has been written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is Darabont's first film since the great \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in 1994. That, too, was based on a King prison story, but this one is very different. It involves the supernatural, for one thing--in a spiritual, not creepy, way.\r\n\r\nBoth movies center on relationships between a white man and a black man. In \"Shawshank\" the black man was the witness to a white man's dogged determination, and here the black man's function is to absorb the pain of whites--to redeem and forgive them. By the end, when he is asked to forgive them for sending him to the electric chair, the story has so well prepared us that the key scenes play like drama, not metaphor, and that is not an easy thing to achieve.\r\n\r\nI have started to suspect that when we talk about \"good acting\" in the movies, we are really discussing two other things: good casting and the creation of characters we react to strongly. Much of a performance is created in the filmmaking itself, in photography and editing and the emotional cues of music. But an actor must have the technical and emotional mastery to embody a character and evoke him persuasively, and the film must give him a character worth portraying. Tom Hanks is our movie Everyman, and his Paul is able to win our sympathy with his level eyes and calm, decent voice. We get a real sense of his efficient staff, of the vile natures of Percy and Wharton, and of the goodness of Coffey--who is embodied by Duncan in a performance that is both acting and being.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a shade over three hours long. I appreciated the extra time, which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years. Stephen King, sometimes dismissed as merely a best-seller, has in his best novels some of the power of ****, who created worlds that enveloped us and populated them with colorful, peculiar, sharply seen characters. King in his strongest work is a storyteller likely to survive as **** has, despite the sniffs of the litcrit establishment.\r\n\r\nBy taking the extra time, Darabont has made King's \"The Green Mile\" into a story which develops and unfolds, which has detail and space. The movie would have been much diminished at two hours--it would have been a series of episodes without context. As Darabont directs it, it tells a story with beginning, middle, end, vivid characters, humor, outrage and emotional release. ****."

Honestly I don't know what genre to categorise it as because it looks like a prison drama but crime, fantasy, drama could be possiblities... We know the black dude behind bars supposedly accused of murder holds some supernatural healing powers or some rubbish and has flies or something coming from his mouth which is bizarre but the healing process you could class as supernatural... The Green Mile stars Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell who I must admit is annoying in this film and so is Doug Hutchison or whatever his name is from The X Files.. This film is about 3 hours long or more and it's totally unnecessary especially since not much happens because all we see is a prisoner being annoying and being put in a padded room and some mouse being clever performing tricks and some big black guy with flies oozing from his mouth and healing the odd person plus one of the prison workers ending up in a mental hospital and one of the prisoners getting shot and a few executions.. To be honest it gets rather boring and the only character I really liked was Tom Hanks's character and Michael Clarke Duncan's character kept crying all the time which was laughably pathetic but I liked Tom Hanks. Besides that The Green Mile delivered nothing and the entertainment value was little and some of the characters were crap and annoying plus alot of the locations looked tacky and you only ever see one part of the prison all through the film which is laughable and dull and why so many rate this garbage as a classic is beyond me. Quite possibly one of the worst films I've seen in a while so if you want a decent prison film or a decent film full stop avoid this turd and watch something else."

The sheer number of different styles on display at all times is unbelievable, and put together really does feel like a moving painting in many ways. I can 100% see all the time and effort that went into it (and the crunch on the poor animators) and it borderline guaranteed this movie a good score on its own. But beyond that, this film still manages to seriously deliver a complex, engaging story between all its characters. They really take their time to establish personal stakes for everyone, and as a result there wasn\u2019t a single moment in this movie I wasn\u2019t invested. It especially nails the villains. Also, its just funny. Like consistently so, I laughed out loud quite a few times. The pacing does drag it down from a perfect score though; every act of the movie feels just a bit too long and especially by the end with how many false endpoints there are it started to wear on my patience. Just as much though, I\u2019m really excited to see how this trilogy ends cause this really impressed me\u2026Even if I think the original is still a bit stronger. That ending hurts, I'm sorry."

It losses the emotion but the problem is that it also loses the fun. It's a very atonal film in terms of direction, which doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama. And the action scenes, which is all the film has, end up falling flat because there's barely any emotional substance to hold it.\n\nBesides the plot starts almost one hour in and the film ends with the plot starting to develop. Most characters just feel extremely supporting character, with almost no presence in the film.\n\nGood things: the film looks good, the animation is good, the music is fine, the peformances are good, the character design are good and the sequel will probably be good."

While the first act may feel a bit slow, the pacing quickly ramps up and keeps the audience thoroughly engaged. The film excels in developing the relationship between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, delivering heartfelt moments that deepen their connection. However, the only drawback is the sense of being left unfulfilled at the end, as this is just part one of the story. Nevertheless, with its stunning animation, engaging plot, and well-crafted character dynamics, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for fans of the franchise."

                    "review": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nThis is only Part 1 of a two-part sequel.  Sweet!  Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening.  It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team.\nWriting credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham.  The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence.  When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.  \n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nThe animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive.  It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect.  Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book.  Fans are completely nerding out!\nThe cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham.\nThe script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time.\nWe get some creative villains that come from various multiverses.\nLots and lots of action!\nThe movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it!  It\u2019s the largest crew of any animated movie ever made!\nSo many Easter eggs.  They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics.  Wow.\nThis is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything.  Scratch that\u2026two or three times!  The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can\u2019t see it all.\nI\u2019ve never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material.\nI got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man.  haha\nI\u2019ve always loved animated movies that include live-action characters.\nThe cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment.\nSurprising twists caught me off guard.  Sweet.\nThere is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual.\nI\u2019ve just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days!  His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience.  The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash.  It\u2019s another fun adventure into the metaverse!\nYou can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you\u2019ll understand and appreciate it even more if you have.\nIf you love Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s character of Gwen Stacey, you\u2019ll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.  \n\nTHINGS I DIDN\u2019T LIKE:\nSome viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn\u2019t actually end at the end and they\u2019ll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story.  Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024.\nSome of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don\u2019t have time to really savor the moment.  \n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:    \nThis is not just some random kids\u2019 movie.  It\u2019s very mature and filled with humor and insights that adults can enjoy.\nSome Spanish is spoken without subtitles."

However, it has lost its essence, at least for me, and has dramatically diminished the meaning of the costume.

I was pretty excited when the multiverse idea was first introduced. But it seems that neither What If!, nor Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Across the Spider-Verse have been able to provide what I was looking for. Worse yet, they are slowly causing me to lose my enthusiasm for Marvel and its characters. It's disheartening."

We are introduced to what is supposed to be a small team of spider people that ends up being the size of a city. What do they do, why are they necessary, who is guarding their universe?\n\n// The second hour fails to introduce us to most of any of the variant spidermen other than surface level intros if that. The geniuses tell miles that his dad has to die and not to save him. Stunning. Miles says F that and he\u2019s going to save his dad. Brave. The spidermen all in unison try to stop him, none of them questioning why they are trying to stop miles. We learn that for some reason miles is not supposed to be Spiderman (which is somehow his fault for existing) and he **** now according to the diverse spider team.\n\n// Miles is captured by prowler miles (spooky?) & then nothing happens and the movie ends.\n\n// The plot is nothing, the movie tells us nothing, the characters are all grating and annoying.

I think there was a joke-cracking villain in a white body suit with black spots all over it. And a bunch of joke-cracking Spider-Men and Women swinging around. And some joke-cracking police chiefs. And a lot of screaming extras (non-player characters) running about while buildings fell on top of **** that\u2019s pretty much **** one very telling \u2014 and eye-rollingly \u2018meta\u2019 \u2014 thread emerged near the end of the movie which made me wonder if writers Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and David Callaham realized they\u2019d written an unauthorized remake of Ira Levin\u2019s \u201cThe Boys From Brazil.\u201dIt turns out that across the many, dull, insider-y \u2018verses\u2019 in the Spider-Verse there are hard and fast \u2018rules\u2019 that dominate all the **** in order to transform a dorky teen into a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d, certain events must take place. Including the death of a father figure. As if trauma could only lead to a specific, exact **** \u201cThe Boys from Brazil\u201d a **** makes a bunch of **** clones and then recreates all the major events from **** life, hoping to make another Fuhrer. And as silly as the movie was, it had the good sense to understand that no two people are going to respond to an event in the exact same **** in \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d, this fact is taken as gospel: Of course every teen who loses a dad is going to turn into a superhero, that\u2019s the rule.Whether the writers are doing a self-own by, in effect, admitting to the ridiculously limiting strictures of their own genre, or simply ignorant to how lazy and repetitive this storyline is, the result is cynical and ****\u2019s as if the filmmakers were saying: \u201cThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re a cookie cutter. What\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d"

            "review": "I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, \"Buffalo Bill.\" \"Bill\" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent \"Clarice Starling\" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as \"Jack Crawford.\" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts \"Clarice,\" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.\"Silence Of The Lambs\" has turned into a modern-day \"classic.\" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."

The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.\n\nJonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.\n\nAll in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

In the second half of \u201cSomething Wild,\u201d Demme demonstrated a marked talent for rough suspense, something he sustains for two hours here.\n\nIn a strong performance, Foster fully registers the inner strength her character must summon up to meet the challenges and occasional humiliations her tough assignment entails.\n\nCast against type as a reserved man in glasses and a suit, Scott Glenn is a very agreeable surprise as the FBI agent who takes a chance by putting his young charge on the case.\n\nThe juiciest part is Hopkins,\u2019 and he makes the most of it. Helped by some highly dramatic lighting, actor makes the role the personification of brilliant, hypnotic evil, and the screen jolts with electricity whenever he is on. This is, without doubt, his most effective film appearance to date.\n\nFrom the huge hall in which Lecter is eerily caged at one point to the dingy rooms of Buffalo Bill\u2019s house, Kristi Zea\u2019s production design is critical to the picture\u2019s mood. Editor Craig McKay keeps doesn\u2019t let a frame stay on too long, and Howard Shore\u2019s rather traditional score outstandingly amplifies the tension and psychological mystery."

That's what it was like for me in 1992 when Silence of the Lambs swept the Oscar's (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). And boy did the movie deserve it. Jonathan Demme's fantastic retelling of the classic book by Thomas Harris. Anthony Hopkins' scene-chewing Hannibal Lecter turned him into a pop culture icon (and unfortunately a slew of middling sequels). And Jodie Foster's grim and naive portrayal of Clarice. The final touch is that haunting score. Some of the best movies out there are elevated by a musical score that puts it another league. A phenomenal classic."

Starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine.\n\nBased on the famous novel by Thomas Harris, and it's about a young FBI cadet who receives the help of Hannibal Lecter, an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims.\n\nThere won't be any kind of spoilers in this review, but I'll discuss some of its scenes deeply, without going into spoilers, just wanted to warn y'all. All set? Let's go then!\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs starts with our protagonist, Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) training with the opening credits. It's a very effective scene, some viewers won't pay much attention to it, but it's really important, it shows us that our protagonist, Clarice, is nothing but a trainee! Of course, that was mentioned later on in the movie, but seeing her training with your own eyes without the characters telling you at first, is such a powerful scene. We get to see that at the climax of the movie too, not just there, we get to see that in almost every scene that genuinely requires her to do a hard decision. And of course, that goes to the stellar performance by Jodie Foster!\n\nWhat makes this character so good to watch, is that she is not a professional FBI agent or whatever, she's a trainee, and she's trying to prove herself, sometimes in doing some really hard stuff, and later on, in the movie that was kinda hinted that she's doing it not to impress the others, but to impress herself and do to face the thing that she's most afraid of. And that does make her character very easy to relate to and to sympathize with her character even more!\n\nThe movie doesn't take time showing us her backstory at the beginning or giving us all the information about all the characters at first, it takes time, and it gives us the information we need about most of the characters, not in the form of a flashback, but mostly in the form of a dialogue, which is even better because if it was in the form of flashbacks we wouldn't have gotten this amazing scene between Lecter and Starling in the prison, where Starling is telling Lecter about the lambs, which is not just my favorite scene in the movie, but one of my favorite scenes of all-time!\n\nWe get quickly to meet Lecter, we get to brief info about him, and how he used to kill and eat his victims, and then we get to meet and see him, and he's not the cannibal we thought he would be, he's very settled, calm, civilized and kinda respectful. And that's another thing this movie nailed, we thought he would be loud and wild, like how he was described, or at least how you imagined he would be, but he's different, even when we get to see him killing and eating a man's lips, he listened to music afterward, which makes him unique and very intriguing.\n\nAnthony Hopkins' performance as Lecter is one of my favorite performances in a horror movie, he nailed this character, every scene he was in it, the tension was there, even though he might be just speaking with someone, or being normal, the way he just talks is very scary!\n\nTed Levine doesn't get many praises for his role in this movie, maybe because he wasn't in this movie a lot, but still, whenever he was on screen he was pretty good. Everyone in this movie is great, everyone did a great job!\n\nThe plot was very intense, the movie doesn't take time, every scene matters, every line builds something, every character is there for a reason, even if it's very minor, but still, it matters, and that's how perfect this movie is, you can watch it and just be mesmerized of how careful the crew was while making this movie.\n\nI didn't read the novel, so I don't know how faithful it was to the source material, but I heard that it was, based on other people's opinions, people who have read the novel and watched the movie.\n\nDemme did a great job with the tension and the thriller, it never got out of its psychological thriller to a supernatural movie, it was always real, and that what makes it scary, with no modern jump scares, it's just pure horror. He did a great job with the psychological study aspects too, he was simply able to build tension and make you on the edge of your seat, even if it's a normal conversation between two characters! His job behind the camera was great, and this movie benefits a lot from his work.\n\nIn the end, The Silence of the Lambs is such a perfect movie, with an amazing guy behind the camera who knows how to make real horror, and two stellar main performances in front of the camera, who simply knew how to deliver this horror. I'm gonna give The Silence of the Lambs an A+!\n\nThank you, guys, for reading my review, more are coming on your way!"

Anthony Hopkins is so memorable people think of him as the primary antagonist, he stole the show too such an extent they made it into an entire franchise solely based around him, they give him a leading actor Oscar an award he shouldn't have even been eligible for considering he's only onscreen for 16 minutes but they didn't care.\n\nJodie Foster also deserves her recognition giving an absolutely stellar performance as the FBI trainee Clarice Starling, the movie uses under utilised filming techniques to draw it's audience in like getting it's actors to deliver lines directly into camera (a very unorthodox method considering the very first thing actors tell you not too do is look at the camera.) it's very effective here and should be done more in films.\n\nThere is analysis videos on YouTube that go in depth into the editing and camerawork during the Clarice and Lector scenes and show the various techniques used to make those scenes some of the best in film history. A masterpiece of a movie with the best end credits sequence I've ever seen."

I've never read the book but the film feels so genuine in its approach just like its main character Clarice starling played by an amazingly vulnerable but strong Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins is also amazing in his role and so is Ted Levine. But it's more than that the screening and the way its adapted is unique and intriguing. There's not one moment that's not supremely engaging. Especially the cleverly written and brilliantly performed dialogue. Its without a doubt a perfect storm that makes this horror thriller an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.\n\nBudget: $19m\nDomestic Box Office: $131m\nWorldwide Box Office: $273m\n\n4.5/5"

I've seen this movie multiple times and I can confidently say it's in my top 3 of all-time best films. With a slow build and subtle foreshadowing, this psychological thriller will be on your mind even weeks after you've seen it. The two main characters of the story have a dynamic that I've never seen in other movies like this before, I'd sometimes forget I was watching a movie because their chemistry on screen was unmatched. A story of a young detective trying to earn her place on the force takes on the task of hunting down a serial killer named \"Buffalo Bill\" who skins women alive. To find more clues she speaks with the famed serial killer Hannibal \"the cannibal\" Lector, a former psychiatrist who helps her break down the clues of the case. The hunting down of Buffalo Bill is merely a side plot while Hannibal is the true star of the film as we see his intelligence and confusing charisma show itself through different scenarios of the movie. The shuttle foreshadowing of Clarice (the detectives) childhood past on a farm impacting her relationship with Hannibal gives us an unspoken story of her true personality and motivations, while Hannibal plays with her thoughts to not only help her with the case but to amuse himself in the process. The film itself lacks action and the blood and guts of traditional horror flicks but the slow build-up pays off at the end.  A movie that leaves no stone unturned is perfect for those who love to analyze and be surprised. The perfect comparison for this movie would be a puzzle, while very few people find thrill in putting a puzzle together, the pride you feel in completion is worth the effort.  The film is boring and drawn out at times but the payoff is the cherry on top. Every film buff and horror lover needs to see this film at least once in their life so they can experience this artful journey."

Armed with an incredible plot, he always finds a space for his character to come forth and have their voices heard. His spin on these scripts is why the characters grow iconic both artistically and culturally. Of course, you'd be then imitating Anthony Hopkins over the years. Their perspectives are kept on table with a panache that would make even the most reserved, head turn and eyes pop. And maybe, that is why, for a character that is barely on screen, gets the nod of being the lead actor in a film. The best actor, to be precise. And there have been said plenty about this Hannibal Lecter over the years.\n\nSo here, I'd like to focus on Jodie Foster. She is the mother of this case. And I feel this for her persona is just as caring as vulnerably open she is about herself. No matter how much powerful everyone else is, no matter how much authority do others have access to, she is the one, consuming all the energy. Just taking it in. And you are waiting for her to express it. Explode onto someone, something. But she doesn't give you that pleasure, just as she won't in front of others.\n\nThat's power. There is something admirable on controlling a scene, a film by being the underrated character. And that is why I love underrated characters, the most. Since the beginning. To say so much, to yell. To be so much, to act. And yet, you steer your emotions inwards. Foster's both character and performance is a testimony to those days that has led us here. The Silence Of The Lambs is a silence that is going to stay with you for ages, not scaring you but consoling you, for a happy ending."

Everything in the movie is based on a funny but very serious **** film does not have script .And it is the only film for which the Academy has become emotional for specific reasons. The set design in the movie is awful. There is neither simplicity nor complexity in it. The story of the movie is full of bugs. The knots of the story are neither real nor fantasy, neither believable nor surreal. A film that is basically a deception. In my opinion, it could have been a more successful movie by switching the roles of Hopkins and Jodie Foster. The pleasure that the story of the movie wants to convey is very confusing and deceptive. Everything suffers from an artificial nostalgia. In the end, it seems that it was one of the few works that I have seen that tries its best to turn a cinematic work into an inhuman tool. Not only is it unsuccessful and it never deceives the professional cinema audience, but it is so ridiculous and funny that it is unbelievable at a certain time. A movie that not only the character but also the style is not seen in **** tasteless and for example tasty inserts don't do anything and the film remains on its basic interesting idea."

            "review": "Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the \"cops on trail of deranged killer\" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.\nThe real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."

What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is ****. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Brad Pitt actually stood out to me more than Morgan Freeman, but both were very easy to root for.

Even the studio, who didn't want a head in a box, all sweet naivete, blind in a sick world.  I especially love how Morgan Freeman controls his own emotions in any scenario.

It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is \"What's in the box?\" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en."

Whilst the effects are obviously with that nineties style, with rear projection and early CGI, they are still incredibly impressive and have that tangible reality to them that elevates them beyond modern CGI-only effects. The sound design is also excellent, memorable and pretty-much faultless. The writing is fantastic and this is what, combined with the groundbreaking effects, elevates this to be a truly timeless classic. The acting and characters contribute to the story and effects. It\u2019s not one aspect that is good, it is all aspects of this film. I even like the 3D conversion they did, it gave us another way to watching this classic. The story really builds on the first film. The action is exciting. The pacing perfect. Shame James Cameron\u2019s newer films are not as good, along with Aliens (1986) this is the peak of his career in my opinion. It\u2019s an awesome action film, the likes of which only come many years apart. Everything about it is totally kickass brilliant."

It was carefully made, plays with expectations and delivers an amazing experience. It had a good mixture of action, character development with an immersive story. Lets start at the beginning: The Terminator was already a really good experience and the story could easily be continued. It is the standard Hollywood rule that if a movie is successful enough you get a sequel no matter what (Curse and blessing of the industry).  It took still quite a while until they started. A frequent reason I read were production issues and that the special effects technology was not good enough. However after solving the issues they could start. Luckily they get the best assets back with James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton atop of many people behind the screen. The story is set approx 10 years after the prequel. The supercomputer Skynet who is at war with humanity in the future sends another Terminator to get rid of John Connor who will lead the human resistance to victory. Again the resistance does send one of them back to stop the Terminator. This sounds firstly like a warmed up retelling or re-shoot of Terminator 1 but you will be surprised how good the story will become and how much effort was put into it (I am vague on purpose to avoid spoilers). The story itself has a lot of good ideas some twists and a mixture of action, story telling and character development / interaction that makes it hard to find flaws. Of cause you can find smarter solutions for Skynet to eliminate John like a virus pandemic or a high bounty to let ruthless humans do the hard work. However these are just thoughts or ideas and will not be used against the movie. I will continue with the actors. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his most iconic role and fully delivers. Same goes for Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. She also fully delivers and got a lot of character development.  Then we got Robert Patrick who is the best addition to the movie. Edward Furlong as (young) John Connor is one of the few good child actors that also started successful career later. He is absolutely believable and relatable. I want to point out for the rest of the cast that there is not one missed scene or awkward acting moment I can remember. Everything fits into the narrative and I think I should praise James Cameron as director (also writer and producer). Visually the movie sets new standards for its time. Be it the sets or especially the special effects. While some special effects look not that impressing today they were amazing and baffled the audience. Then there are of cause the action sequences and they do nothing halfhearted. Often I hold my breath because these were so intense, immersive and entertaining. The stunt team deserves credits. Overall this is rightfully named as one of the best sequels of all times and outclasses the prequel. It is one of the most well know movies of all time, pop culture legend and so carefully made that it is easy to recommend. It is the best of the franchise and the kind of movie all later installments try to reach or surpass (Hint: They never came close again)."

And it is also a film that I saw as a child, and that I stop to watch almost every time it is on television, which happens regularly. It is also one of the rare and commendable examples of a cinema sequel that went far beyond the initial film and became memorable in all aspects.\n\nIn this film, John Connor is a troubled and rebellious boy. He doesn't know, but one day he will be the head **** that will fight for humanity in a war against machines. He discovers this when he faces a fearsome liquid metal killer, an Exterminator, sent from the future to assassinate him. But he will be able to count on the help of another machine: an older version of Terminator, like the one that, fifteen years earlier, pursued his mother, Sarah, and that he himself, in the future, will send to the past, aware of that it will save your life.\n\nIf it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action. And there are few action films that turn out to be so absolutely incredible. The film barely lets us breathe, and the way it develops is remarkable. We have mind-boggling pursuits in which a man on foot chases a car, we have shootings and explosions in almost every sequence and the sense of danger and tension that it creates is genuine and follows us to the end. Speaking of the ending... it's hard to imagine a more moving and emotional ending scene. In addition to the ending, the action sequences at the hospital and at Skynet headquarters are worthy of anthology.\n\nIn this film, the star is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has built up an image of toughness and, in fact, he is tough like no other actor before him: he looks indestructible and has iron determination. Even so, there are moments when he gives psychological and emotional depth to his character, a killer machine, and that is enough to have a sense of the actor's quality. Linda Hamilton goes back to the role she already knows, but leaves behind the naive girl from the first film: here, she is a woman of arms, determined and with a colossal inner strength. Edward Furlong also achieves his most successful role here. He seemed perfect in the role of a rebel without a cause and has a perfect collaboration with Schwarzenegger. Robert Patrick is usually the actor that people stand out the least, but I think he was impeccable in the role of the villain and that he put a lot of effort in the role. Joe Morton, Earl Boen and Castulo Guerra also make a positive contribution in supporting roles.\n\nJames Cameron ensures an inspired direction and achieves, with this film, one of the most impressive works of his career. Filmed and premiered in 1991, the film is extraordinarily up-to-date: if I didn't know what the film is, I could assume it is a recent production. Cinematography is magnificent, dark at the right times, and the sets and costumes are good. But it is the visual and special effects that transform the film into something even more impactful, especially with regard to the T-1000 and its liquid forms. They look like current effects, made with modern techniques. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack, designed by Brad Fiedel and, undoubtedly, one of the most striking songs in cinema."

Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.\n\nHere in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.\n\nLinda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.\n\nIn conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox"

            "review": "What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the \"prequel\" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly \"sell out,\" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most \"princess\" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi \"storm troopers.\" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :."

It captures a wide range of emotions, all of them perfectly - fear, sadness, happiness, humor, adventure, tension, and, above all, magic... The main characters have grown so iconic that it's difficult to remember how amazing it is how awesome they are, and how well they work together as characters. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, Obi-Wan, Vader... They all work so perfectly together. And that third act... The trench run is a truly astounding sequence, and is the most tense action scene in a film that I've ever seen. It's still near- perfect, even 46 years later. A fantastic film, and only improved by later installments."

The Star Wars Universe is expansive, magnificent, and full of options, therefore this film truly marks the start of the greatest film franchise of all time. Even if several of the scenes felt avant-garde at the time they were released in theatres, the public nonetheless praised them highly."

Fantastic on its own, but watch it in Machete Order (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Attack of The Clones, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi.) to get the best experience of this legendary masterpiece."

                    "review": "I had been seeing a lot of memes about Star Wars, that added with the fact that Rise of the Skywalker was about to release were the reasons why I decided to take a look at the franchise. After all, I was tired of always running away from any discussion regarding these movies. So finally after having downloaded all the movies I began from A New Hope (I didn't know the order, I just guessed that since it's the oldest so it has to be seen first. If I hadn't seen that I'd have started with Phantom Menace). And I'm really mad that I never saw these before.\n\nStar Wars is like a dream come true for someone like me, who is so much obsessed with astronomy. I have always liked stories in which there is a simple character who is living an easy life, completely secluded from the rest of the world when someone decides to take them on an adventure. It happened in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey and Lord of the Rings, but this is the first time it was ever shown on a big screen. I can very well imagine how excited everyone must have been back then. There are all kinds of interesting characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca, Princess Leia and of course, the iconic Darth Vader. Today these are the same characters I think of when someone says \"Space adventure\".\n\nThe action of this movie is the selling point. Although we can see the campiness and that there is always a jump cut between the Jedi jumping and landing, it is not very hard to watch like another big CGI movie franchise we all know. The characters have some depth to them, which is what makes them so interesting to watch. I really liked Han Solo's entrance, the way he was gambling in the bar and then suddenly attacked the enemies with Chewbacca. Every time Darth Vader appeared on screen it felt like so dramatic. It feels fresh even today.\n\nThe problem with this movie is, however, that it's too old. It is way too oldie, if that makes sense. All the characters talk like the old movies, which is hard for a non-English speaker like me to relate to since I don't see someone talking while barely moving their mouth the way Harrison Ford does, or always have the teach showing even with the mouth closed like Mark Hamill does. Another example can be like whenever they hide from Stormtroopers and talk to each other in a low voice, Chewbacca keeps moaning loudly but the Stormtroopers don't hear him. When he did it the first time I thought Han would probably ask him to keep his voice down or the Stormtroopers will notice them. For some reason I don't feel like watching old movies. They make me feel sleepy. This is the reason why I dozed off watching it and then watched the remaining after waking up.\n\nI consider Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope to be the movie which created the divide between Hollywood and Bollywood. Before that both of them were going almost pretty much equal. But after 1977 while Star Wars helped Hollywood grow, Bollywood remained stuck in the same era or rather should I say, went back in time. All the big CGI movies that we see today are indirectly a result of Star Wars being the success that it was. I really hope the franchise returns back to its roots."

            "reviewer": "kraleyOct 4, 2002",
            "review": "Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to \"suit American audiences\". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange \"theme park\" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very \"wrong\" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a \"kiddee film\") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit \"weirded out\" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the \"kidney-buster\" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like \"cartoon movies\", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."

I must say, even now, I haven't encountered a movie quite like Hayao Miyazaki's remarkable animated creation from 2001. Everything about this film, from its characters to the tale it weaves, not to mention the exquisite hand-drawn world it unfolds within, held my complete attention right from the start. It's safe to declare that anyone who hasn't experienced this cinematic gem is definitely missing out on one of the finest hand-drawn animated films ever brought to life.\n\nFor me, \"Spirited Away\" carries a special significance, and I'm certain many others feel the same way. Miyazaki's storytelling imparts a distinctive and intimate touch to the entire narrative. Many situations within the film resonate deeply with viewers, whether it's Chihiro's journey, Haku's and Chihiro\u2019s budding friendship, or the enigmatic and mysterious No-Face trying to find its place in the world. The reason this movie holds such a dear place in my heart is intertwined with a close friend who recommended it to me. While watching, I couldn't help but imagine her stepping into Chihiro's shoes. The film's personal and relatable themes foster a strong connection between the screen and its audience.\n\nAt its core, Chihiro's story is one of personal growth. Throughout \"Spirited Away,\" we follow Chihiro through relatable challenges, even though they unfold in Miyazaki's imaginative realm of spirits. Amidst moments of joy and triumph, we witness Chihiro evolve into a stronger individual, shaped by her struggles and moments of adversity.\n\nSince my initial viewing a few years ago, \"Spirited Away\" has swiftly secured its place as my all-time favorite movie. I'd award it a rating of 9.8/10, coming incredibly close to the realm of cinematic perfection, at least in my eyes. I must admit, I'm quite influenced by my personal connection to the film, but I genuinely believe that Miyazaki truly outdid himself with this creation. While its runtime of 2 hours and 5 minutes demands an investment of time, it's one you'll undoubtedly find worthwhile."

Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film tells the story of a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in a magical world inhabited by gods and spirits. As she tries to find her way back home, Chihiro learns valuable lessons about friendship, courage, and the importance of family.\n\nThe animation in Spirited Away is breathtakingly beautiful, with every frame bursting with color, detail, and imagination. The creatures and landscapes are so richly rendered that they feel like they could come to life at any moment. The music, too, is a perfect complement to the visuals, adding depth and emotion to every scene.\n\nBut what truly sets Spirited Away apart is its heart. Despite the fantastical setting, the film is grounded in real human emotions and experiences. Chihiro's journey is one that anyone can relate to, and her growth throughout the film is both inspiring and poignant. By the end of the film, you feel as though you've gone on an incredible journey with her.\n\nIn short, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of animated cinema that deserves all the acclaim it has received. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and that you will want to revisit time and time again. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible."

This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I have always heard pleasant things about this particular film from everybody who has seen it. I have not heard of a single person who did not enjoy Spirited Away. Until 2020, Spirited Away was so popular that it was the highest grossing anime movie of all time. As I began to watch the movie, I was unfortunately disappointed. I did not understand the hype at all. I will not deny that this movie is spectacularly animated with some of the most gorgeous scenes in animated history, but that, to me at least, did not make up for the slow and unspectacular plot. The movie follows a girl named Chihiro, who is often referred to as Sen, as she enters the spirit world. Her patents have been turned into pigs, and to save them, she must get a job at a spirit bath house. Sen is a wonderfully brave girl who has so much love and kindness in her heart that she displays throughout the movie, particularly towards the end, that the viewer cannot help but to smile. I really liked a lot about this movie, but in particular, I loved the unique and imaginative characters and world. Studio Ghibli is known for creating iconic and lovable characters, and this is undoubtably true in this movie."

I didn't like this film at all, and was constantly throwing a tantrum at every scene. First of all I had never liked anime, probably my sister had heard about this from school. And secondly I could have been playing browser games instead of watching this. But now when I look back at it, this is one of the best anime films I have watched. However, since I saw this film over twelve years ago, my knowledge is not very fresh and I might make some mistakes while writing this review.\nAs I have grown into becoming an artist now, the idea of this film has started to make sense. The film begins in an absolutely surreal manner. The idea behind the girl's parents turning into pigs after eating like them is quite scary, which is exactly what the film wants us to feel. I remember I was thinking why she doesn't sit and eat with them. I have always been such a foodie, I might have as well ended up like them if I were there. And then this girl had to run away and live among the monsters. Each one of them was traumatising, except the woman whom Spider-Eggman convinces by giving her a roasted lizard.\nNow I won't go too much in detail for the characters or the story, since I don't think I remember anything correctly. As I write this review I am getting occasional glimpse of some scenes, particularly the slime monster one. So all I'm gonna talk about are the other aspects of this film. First of all, this film is a dream for any postmodernist art lover. The idea of random things happening, the characters who can only exist in a fever dream interacting with the girl and the old woman - everything about this is like something Salvador Dali would be proud of.\nThe only problem I had in this film is from the plot holes. I could be wrong since I watched it so long back, that too while throwing a tantrum and not wanting to watch this film (I have completely forgotten the part where the black Shy Guy meets the girl; I believe it happens in this film?). The part where the girl tries cleaning the muck from the bath and the slime monster gets upset and start chasing her; how do they suddenly become friends? Just because the monster got tired from chasing her? That scene has never made any sense to me. Also who was that boy who came in the beginning? How come he never got to do the work the girl was doing, irrespective of whether he himself was a monster or a human? Either way it makes the film look like a nightmare, which I'm pretty sure it wasn't trying to.\nSen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (this is the actual name of this film) is the first and by far the only Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen. Even though I don't know much about his signature style, this film gave me a vague idea of how he is different from the conventional anime artists. In case all his films are like this, I'd really hope to see them all. And I'd personally want to apologise for the bad time I gave my sister while watching it."

Goro Miyazaki, the son, made that one; Hayao Miyazaki, the father, made this one. Spirited Away is an outstanding movie that takes a simple story and makes so much more of it. I probably missed lots of the Japanese references, but this movie works also for me as Westerner. It is the story of a young girl who gets lost in a magic world where she has to save her parents before she can escape it.\n\nChihiro, the principal character is the key to this movie. She is vulnerable, brave, resourceful and likable. Most anime relegate girls to the side; there to be saved by the male hero and applaud him. They can be all Chihiro is, but never center stage; always in the shadow of a male figure.\n\nThis movie could have fallen for this clich\u00e9 too. Chihiro meets Haku, a young boy that helps her at the start. But he never takes the lead and doesn\u2019t dominate the movie. In fact, he isn\u2019t in most of the movie. And in the end it is Chihiro who saves Haku. The movie is closely knit. On the surface, it feels like a Japanese version of Alice in Wonderland. It has that same mood, that same strangeness. Some characters, like Yubaba seems like the Queen of Hearts. There is that similar feel, but it never feels like a rip-off.\n\nThere are many layers to this movie. It isn\u2019t just that Chihiro herself undergoes a story arc, but where she goes she touches everyone: her optimistic nature and kindness affect others. And where the world of spirits is initially hostile to humans, she earns their respect and eventually changes their nature, as they change her. Yubaba, for instance, changes from a hateful person towards a kinder one. Her baby, a selfish individual who never goes out, changes too, when he travels with Chihiro.\n\nThere is also a twist near the end of the movie that is foreshadowed throughout the movie. You might find some things strange(I won\u2019t say what because I don\u2019t want to spoil it), but you discover everything is there for a reason.\n\nI would sincerely recommend if you like a layered story with a likable character. I give it a nine not because it isn\u2019t worth a ten, but I always keep that last number in reserve, just in case there is a movie more perfect than this one in its category."

Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in."

One minute of action. One minute it's quiet. It would alternate like that and then suddenly it would be over and I really enjoyed these almost 3 hours, especially the action sequences, which I really enjoyed and I thought were very well done. That's what won me over. With its excellent action, which stopped for a while, but then always came back in full force. Story-wise I wasn't particularly impressed, although I liked very much that it wasn't a fairy tale and that it was grittier. The main draw for me was the aforementioned action, of which there was plenty. A great film that I can recommend to fans of war themes."

I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.\n\nThe acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.\n\nIt does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.\n\n8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times. But it deserves to be in the top 250, really it is that good! Bethany Cox"

I really can\u2019t explain the way this movie make me feel, everything has weight in it, if these people can\u2019t save Ryan then their screwed. Everything about it is amazing the cast, everyone does a fantastic job obviously Tom Hanks is the standout. I have never seen Tom actually be in a really serious role, I mean in Green Mile he was still serious but still was a light hearted character but in this he\u2019s full on more serious then I\u2019ve ever seen. The score it\u2019s John Williams obviously it\u2019s amazing. Overall just go and watch this movie please. Ranking Masterpiece"

Less of a movie and more of a parable, a reminder of heroism and an experience and an exercise in empathy for a new generation when it came out and today. What struck me immediately with the 4K transfer, besides the vivid colours of fire and blood, and those incredible and soulful close-ups, is how the documentary style of the film is still often so present and immediate and fresh. It revivifies the themes and the meaning of the film all over again and a perfect promotion for what upgrading the quality of films can do for them. This too happened with Apocalypse, Now: Final Cut. Saving Private Ryan is a film constructed to say so much with so little, the characters of the film follow the same rule, effortlessly watchable with no one painted with broad strokes and left, like comrades, with their depth and uniqueness just bubbling beneath the surface. The aural soundscape is second to none, overwhelmingly impressive and immersive. There\u2019s nothing sadistic about this film and yet it is brutal and pulls no punches. It\u2019s a warm hearted warning about war and a subtle and unstuffy character study about men at war."

According to the script, after the death of three brothers in combat (two in Normandy and one in the Pacific), the US Army decides to send a detachment with the mission of finding the last brother, who was launched with an infantry company. Skydiver somewhere in northern France. Only recently, after some research, did I discover that the film was based, very slightly, on a real event. The script is good, full of action scenes and will surely delight the lovers of war movies and WWII movies. Personally, I highlight the opening scenes, in which \"D-Day\" was recreated in all its raw glory, and the final part, where it all comes together in an almost perfect climax of action.\n\nThe director's chair was taken by iconic Steven Spielberg, who is spotless once again. He is one of those directors who no longer has to prove anything. More than established, he was already one of the best directors of our time when he directed this movie. Even so, he did not cease to strive and to provide us with careful, attentive and thoughtful direction. At his side, in the starring role, Tom Hanks in one of the films that marked his career. Hanks is a renowned actor. Attentive to detail and emotional when it has to be, she shone once more, earning another Oscar nomination for Best Actor (though attributed to the equally remarkable Roberto Benigni, in one of the most hilarious and emotional moments the Academy ceremony has ever seen. in many decades). The supporting cast is equally good, containing names like Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, etc. Actors who, as we can see, are established and generally have solid careers today.\n\nThe film shone equally on the technical details. It's a Spielberg movie, and we couldn't expect anything else. Let's look at the careful way in which the historical details were mostly recreated. The uniforms, military equipment, combat tactics were all carefully studied, and despite some flaws (such as the predominance of the Americans and the absence of other allies in the theater of war), all went well. I especially liked that they used the German language for the German soldiers. I also highlight the excellent photography, with breathtaking scenes and original camera angles (one moment we are looking through a sniper sight, and the next moment a bullet crosses that same sight towards us, to name but a few). an example), as well as the sound effects, with all those absolutely realistic bullet sounds and shots. The characterization, the special effects, the soundtrack ... all meticulously well done.\n\nPersonally, I liked this movie a lot. It's one of those movies that I like to see again after a few years, but which has disappeared without a trace of the television circuit, perhaps because of its length and the fact that it is no longer a new movie. It also has some minor flaws, such as some concessions to sentimental lamechas and scenes of strong emotional appeal, but I confess that I handled it very well. The scene that seemed to me the most out of context was, in fact, a passage involving a French family with their young children. Another problem with this movie is that, with the exception of the character of Hanks, most of the characters have been underdeveloped and the actors have little to work with, just playing wars.\n\nThis movie has garnered several awards. Of all, I highlight his good performance at this year's Oscars, with five statuettes collected in the technical categories (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Edition, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects). He also won the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Film."

However it gets to the point so many mangled bodies and bits all over the place the gore ends up oversaturated. I zoned out a lot on re-watch and tapped out when they found private Ryan. Sometimes the attempt at realism numbs the experience and it doesn't work on a emotional level. Like Hacksaw Ridge worked better, because the intense gore was only in the final battle scenes at the end of the movie. It built up the contrast of the civilian home life first. Then thrust the audience into the shock and awe battle scenes later. So no constant oversaturation of gore all through the movie like this one. Hacksaw Ridge showed it didn't tell. This movie did a lot tell with the characters backstory. So no deep connection to characters. The intense gore cannot the hide the formulaic war story with shallow characterisation. That being said \"Thank you for your service\". Nope not the actors, but the IRL vets past and present."

One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.\n\nPerhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be \"entertained\". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.\n\n'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.\n\nThe story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.\n\nAlexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.\n\nOverall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

This film deserves much more recognition and appreciation than it gets, as it does everything so well. The visual style is remarkable, the storytelling is powerful, the narrative is captivating, and the acting is very believable. I was thoroughly and consistently entertained. If there's anything that this movie falls short on, it's simply that the storytelling mechanics of jumping from character to character do not allow for the viewer to connect as deeply as they might with a standard film protagonist. However, I think that what was lost in that regard was made up for in the mechanism's ability to show the more complete and intertwined narrative that this film captures. Overall, a wonderful film that's certainly going among my favorites."

Because without being so, City of God wouldn't have been the easiest hard-to-watch movie to be watched! I know that sounds weird, but I'm not kidding this movie is so disturbing and shocking, but its vibrant visual style made it impossible to look away from.\n\nLike the visuals and colors, the soundtrack is so vivid and dynamic to mirror the vicious cycle of violence in the eponymous city, and the slums of Rio de Janiero.\n\nThat being said, City of God's exhilarating visuals and soundtrack aren't the only, nor even the main two reasons that made it unbelievably engrossing. As what really dazzled me the most this masterpiece is its narrative control. Considering the fact that this movie has this abundance of characters, which all of them are almost equally important, and a non-linear storytelling, it's beyond belief that I haven't felt lost even for a moment. Instead, I found myself caring for each of the main characters for equal measure. Every time our protagonist, Rocket mentions one of the new important characters while narrating the story, I start getting worried a bit because I think this would harm the narrative thread of the story, and make it lose its balance a bit. But every time I ended up being totally wrong till I eventually said to myself: \"More characters, please!\" By the way, the use of voice-over narration in this movie is exceptional!\n\nEvery single character is as grounded as its compelling and throughly interesting. And they are brought to life by some of the most authentic, honest, and uncompromising performances I've ever seen in film. All the non-pros actors delivered downright terrific performances that I really can't single hand one of them.\n\nThe only issue I've with City of God is its first fast-paced 20 minutes. Putting aside the magnificent opening scene, everything in the rest of the first fifty to twenty minutes happens very quickly that kept me from being engaged from the start.\n\nPowerful, visceral, uncompromising, yet honest, Cidade de Deus is a Latin masterpiece, and easily one of the this century's best movies, so far. I really regret not seeing it till recently, it's a MUST-SEE!\n\n(9/10)"

Noting is taboo as the movie shows children being shot, countless dead bodies, and ruthless behavior; all the more shocking because it's real. The movie takes place in the City of God, an area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, far from the places shown on the touristy postcards. It's a slum, and it seems like you'd be lucky to make it into your 20's living there. The story follows a young man named Rocket as he aspires to be a photographer, while showing bleak backdrop of the drug trade and constant gang warfare in the area. The director purposefully uses little-known actors to make the feel of the movie more authentic, and the way he presents the material through the stunning cinematography and a superb script is amazing. I'm shocked it didn't succeed in getting nominated for best Foreign Language film at the Oscars, but nonetheless it is a powerful and important film that earns its critical praise. Some viewers will be unable to watch parts of this movie; it really is that shocking."

Unashamedly brutal and honest, City of God provides a brilliant look at life in the slums of Brazil through the eyes of a boy who dreams of becoming a photographer and while he is not involved in gang life, he is undeniably touched by it and it is a huge part of who he is. The acting, directing, and cinematography, are all pitch perfect and the storytelling here works very well. It is a great example of world cinema since it is a Brazilian film and a great example of how it does not matter what language a film is in, as long as it is very good and this one certainly fits that bill. Overall, I was very impressed with this film and it undoubtedly rings true for those living in this unfortunate situation. While brutal and sad at times, this one is a foreign language classic."

Each with very similar lives, but who take vastly different paths. This juxtaposition is what drives the narrative in City Of God, and what makes it so compelling.\r\n\r\nRocket feels out of place in the world he lives. he wants to be a photographer. We know from the moment we meet him that he longs to rise above the horrendous poverty and crime that envelopes him. He stands out in this world, others are naturally drawn to his soft temperament and demeanor even if they don't realize the reason. Rocket does not readily have the means to rise above this world so consequently he comes across many stumbling blocks in his life. One of the more interesting sequences in the film is when Rocket concludes that he has no other options than to resort to the life most of his peers have. How this decision plays out results in some of the more lighthearted moments in City Of God. While Rocket's path may not be more interesting than others in the story, it is the most sympathetic.\r\n\r\nLi'l Ze is the polar opposite of Rocket. He doesn't long to rise above this world, he longs to rule over it. The perverse crime and violence he sees all around him doesn't hinder him, it compels him. Li'l Ze earns the kind of respect that comes from brute force, and he learns these tactics at a frighteningly young age. If Li'l Ze is going to be a criminal he is determined to the most powerful criminal in the City of God. This is his only motivation, and what he allows to define his existence.\r\n\r\nThere are many other characters in City Of God. This film has lots of moving parts. However most of the other players move within the framework of the two main characters. Rocket and Li'l Ze are the black and white of the movie, while the other characters represent the shades of gray. It is an interesting way to tell a story, and works exceptionally well here.\r\n\r\nIf I have an issue with City of God it is with the way the movie was shot. We get very few static shots in this film. Everything is quick cuts and shaky camera. While this style never completely keeps me from enjoying a film, it can detract from my enjoyment some. It is very hard to get a sense of time and place when this style is employed, City if God was no exception to this. It also make it difficult to differentiate between the good and bad acting within this style. I suppose this can work positively for the director, but I still consider it a detriment.\r\n\r\nOverall I would consider City of God a great crime drama. The story is extremely well told, with many interesting memorable characters. This is the kind of movie that is still with you weeks or months after you see it. I am looking forward to revisiting it in the future."

                    "review": "As much as I do love Ran, The Hidden Fortress and Throne of Blood, it was Seven Samurai that I love most of Akira Kurasawa's films. As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts. Overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and I'd say that Seven Samurai and Ran are among the best movies ever made) Seven Samurai stands tall. One of the easiest 10/10s I've ever given. Bethany Cox"

En comparaison, la v\u00e9ritable noblesse d'\u00e2me de ces 7 samoura\u00efs, leur d\u00e9vouement et leur engagement n'en apparaissent que plus admirables encore.\n\nLe film est certes long et aurait m\u00e9rit\u00e9 quelques coupes mais on ne s'y ennuie pas, loin de l\u00e0 : c'est  bien construit et mis en sc\u00e8ne avec une pr\u00e9cision \u00e9tonnante. Et contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'on faisait en Europe ou aux Etats-Unis, ici au Japon, on h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 filmer la nuit ! et on le fait tr\u00e8s bien.

It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, choreography and production design. Akira Kurosawa; the screenwriter and director, has done an excellent on executing the anticipated vision, and also keeping the tone of the feature alive for such a long period, takes a lot skill and passion towards the project to pull it off. Each individual character in here is allotted a specific track to portray which they do hold on to tightly. There is a lot of concrete material which never gets overstuffed, as the makers take their time whilst holding few tactics to keep the audience on the edge of the seat and engaged through the process. Shichinin No Samurai is an emblem of unity that shines unflinchingly that is at best a classic culmination of all genres and at worst an action packed feature; both the side, it's a win-win."

                    "review": "If there were a definitive shortlist of films that could be considered the best one ever made, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai would most likely be on that list. The story of seven samurai being hired by a village to defend it from bandits is an action adventure film for the ages that has been cited as one of the most influential films of all-time. With its general plotting being used by a variety of westerns after its release and its battle scenes influencing action movies to this day and setting the bar for both, it is easy to see how this influence has been demonstrated over time. Yet, what is unmistakable is how much this film is influenced by the very genre it later influenced. Set in Japan during a civil war in which peasants and farmers are going hungry, the film's general layout is one that had been well-trodden by the American western by the time Seven Samurai came out in 1954. With a cowboy vs the Indians type of setup in its back pocket, Kurosawa's film plays out more like a western than it does a samurai movie, as would later be the case in other Kurosawa films such as Kagemusha and Ran. Though the film references honor and the Samurai code, these men are not absolutely samurai. Instead, they function akin to gunslingers with swords and feels akin to an epic western more than it does a samurai film.\n\nWith exquisitely choreographed fight scenes between sword-wielding townsfolk and samurai against the invading bandits, the film's epic ambitions are simply found in these attacks. The film is not so much solely about the action, but it is certainly a key reason as to why it is so excellent. As samurai leader Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) checks off the number of dead bandits and plans for how they will defend the ensuing attack, the film becomes a chess match between the minds of the samurai and the minds of the bandits. Though, in the end, the samurai win by tricking the bandits each time, it is compelling to watch the two do battle in the name of this village. When the two sides meet, the arrows flying, the guns shooting, and the swords slicing are beautifully orchestrated and practically like visual poetry.\n\nThat said, it is in these action scenes that lies my biggest complaint. Vowing to take the village and burn it down, the bandits do not expect to find the samurai. Yet, even though their numbers dwindle significantly, they keep attacking. While it would be shameful to admit defeat, their only purpose is to take the village and hurt the peasants. There is no greater war they are a part of and they know that there is nothing of value in the village. Yet, they keep attacking in wave-after-wave. It was tough to figure out why exactly they were so insistent on attacking even when it became rather evident that they were severely outmatched by the samurai.\n\nHowever, in saying that, it is hard to find fault with much of the film. Its writing is excellent, its theme of people of opposite causes who hate one another (farmers and samurai) coming together for a common cause is excellent, and its acting is always impeccable. While Kurosawa being able to play with colors is always a treat, watching in black-and-white is still a sight to behold. Not only is the action beautifully put together, but every shot bears a gorgeous poetic nature to it as he soaks in the beauty of the village and the surrounding area. In more contained and close quarter shots, the film is equally as beautiful with the film seemingly never missing a beat visually. In every front, Seven Samurai is an absolutely excellent film in which its ambitions absolutely are met in roaring fashion. However, to nitpick further, it did feel far too long. As previously mentioned, the fact that the bandits just kept coming certainly plays into this as the samurai have to kill 40 bandits for the film to end. Had the bandits rightfully backed off, the film's length would have been far more digestible. As it stands, many of the battle scenes are rather repetitive and just rehashes of the one prior with slightly different strategies at play. Again, a nitpick, but an issue nonetheless.\n\nAn epic and greatly influential film, Seven Samurai lives up to its billing as one of the best films ever made, even if I had some rather small complaints that hold it back in my eyes. Its beauty is unmistakable, however, with its lyrical nature becoming quite intoxicating and its human relations being raw, powerful, and a perfect encapsulation of the one thing that unites us all: death."

All of these are just naming a few great elements of what makes a movie so special, as there's plenty more out there that I probably left out, but those are mostly the key ones that some film makers choice when making a movie. But when I watch a movie, the first thing I look for is hidden quality, storytelling by the characters movements, acting, lighting, and the use of silence to add emotion to a scene. And yes, this movie absolutely has all of those things I love in movies and much more. I think I died and went to movie heaven.\r\n\r\nSometimes when I talk about a beloved movie that many film makers  and critics out there consider a \"masterpiece\", I think it's very important for me to talk about the actual film making and what makes it so great, as this gives a better thought of what I see when I watched the movie. I mean, it's much better than saying what you like or didn't about a film without talking about the film making itself. Oh and this also my first Akira Kurosawa movie I've watched and reviewed, so there's that. I've heard nothing but amazing things about Kurosawa movies and how every famous director has put him up there as the best director that has ever lived, and I totally understand why, because Akira Kurosawa is one of the most stylish,  influential, and one of the most tremendous film maker that has ever lived. From start till finish, I was completely in awed from what I was watching and it's still fresh in my mind as I'm writing this.\r\n\r\nFor Kurosawa's film career, he has made over 30 films and a few TV movies, but \"Seven Samurai\" seems to be the one movie that everyone knows about (even if there haven't seen it). And I understand why, as everything with the camera work, editing transitions, and the use of mother nature as an emotional trigger for the audience, is everything that an audience can emotional relate to and draw their eye to. Because the choices of weather used in scenes that basically sums up what kind of mood a character or a scene itself is feeling. Wind, sunshine, and rain, really do add a lot to the scene, as you can tell what you're suppose to be feeling. Akira Kurosawa was quite famous for how he wanted to get the weather perfect in his scenes. Over a course of a year, he shot this movie for 148 days and it was often him waiting for the weather for the next scene.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not all, Kurosawa told his actors to chose a gesture for their character and stick with it. That way, we know exactly what kind person their are and how they're feeling. It's bold film making like this is what made Akira Kurosawa a massive influence to cinema today.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about this movie is the characters, as I actually did care for them and their struggle. I sometimes find it very hard to have a full emotional attachment to characters in movies, but here, it amazes me how I know so much from the characters just by their movements that really dose say a lot without them saying anything. All the praise has to go to the actors for this, as it was them who had to deliver and they absolutely do. I'm unaware with all of these actors, but then again, I don't watch that much black and white Japans movies these days. All of the cast were all superb in their roles and most have been a very different cult challenge to pull off, because it's not easy as it looks, but all of them nailed it.\r\n\r\nThe camera work in this movie is so impressive, so unique, and freaking glorious. The way the camera moves tells a story of itself that doesn't require any character to spill out the story or what's going on. I could show any scenes from this movie to someone who hasn't see the movie themselves and even they will have a full grasp on whats going or how someone is feeling without knowing nothing about the movie itself. That's how brilliant this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: Seven Samurai is a epic masterpiece with flawless imagery and a unique style of violence and battles. I can not wait to see Kurosawa other movies, as I have a feeling I'm going to love them."

This is a classic example of truly deep cinema that will never be able to be recreated. Simply breathtaking from the performances to the sets, everything is outstanding. Kurosawa was famous for being a perfectionist when it came to his sets and it shines through here. The villages look incredible and everything looks perfect, including the costumes. The action is without par and extremely realistic, which adds to the sense of realism and drama unfolding before us. A perfect film."

I still can't get around the fact that Kurosawa wrote each of the characters background just for this movie; now that's commitment.\n\nThe story seems straightforward on the surface but it's the driving point of each characters development that is put into focus. Each performance is nuanced and even Mifune's seemingly goofy performance lies a history that drives to do what he does. One of my favorite movies and should not be missed."

I am not one to talk about film length very often, I think a film should be however long it takes the director to tell the story. I will admit however when I fired up Seven Samurai on Hulu and 3:46 appeared at the bottom I was very worried. Making it through a 1954 foreign language action film of this length did not seem like something i was ready for. Kurosawa however doesn't waste a scene in this film even if many scenes are a little more on the nose than I would prefer.\r\n\r\nMy problems with the film are the same problems that I have with a lot of classic films. All of our characters are one dimensional which makes them fairly predictable. We know what purpose they will serve in the plot almost from the moment we meet them, to the point where we can predict which characters are probable to live and which will likely die.\r\n\r\nI also have an issue with the portrayal of the peasants in this film. The peasants are the center of our story and are treated with disdain by all of the characters around them. While this is understandable in the context of the film, I felt throughout that Kurosawa treated them the same way. Every peasant, except possibly one, in this film is treated like a fearful moron. Often they are seen running around aimlessly babbling incoherently to each other. When they do engage our heroes in conversation they have nothing to add to the process that is transpiring. There is no better evidence of this than in one of our seven heroes. As soon as we meet this character we know he will be a part of our group, yet he is always treated like a punch line. He is treated like that by the other characters because he is written like that by our story teller. In one of the plot twists midway through the film it is revealed he is a peasant. This comes as no surprise because of the seven samurai he is the most peasant like. Each character must fit into a stereotype. What engaged me in this film is the glimpse into the culture as well as the cinematography. For a movie made in 1954 it looks amazing. We are transported into this world through the landscapes, through the poverty that is portrayed visually, and through the way the characters interact with one another. Kurosawa also does a fantastic job with the action in this film. In a movie that the plot revolves entirely around a village protecting itself it would have been easy to just piece action scene after action scene together. Kurosawa never does this, the action is always handled in a very intelligent way. Giving us just what we need to get the next part of the story.\r\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and am looking forward to seeing more of Kurosawa's work. I am reluctant to give classic films like this star ratings, as they rarely engage me the way they need to emotionally to warrant consideration in my favorites, or multiple viewings. This film reminds me of Citizen Kane in that I respect it more than I love it, and will probably reference it more than I will watch it."

            "review": "This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas."

However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining, doesn't justify so much buzz. It's a good movie, and there's no doubt about it, but it's not exactly a work of art, as many good commentators have argued. In fact, from the filmography of those involved, it's a film that doesn't even stand out: James Stewart is much more interesting in Hitchcock's films, who knew how to get the best out of the actor, and even Frank Capra made films as or more remarkable than this one.\n\nThe script is very simple: an angel is sent to help a man at the most difficult moment of his life, when everything indicates that he will be arrested after sacrificing his life and dreams to maintain the firm that his father left him, and that prevents an unscrupulous local millionaire from completely taking over the city and doing what he wants with the people who live there. We are, therefore, facing another Christmas movie, where faith and hope are the main focus. The script, well written and effective, is one of the film's strong points: in addition to bringing us a good story that appeals to the whole family, it is based largely on a main character so pleasant that it is impossible not to like her and just watch. The movie just to see how she will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nThe cast is headed by James Stewart, one of the great actors of this time, in another excellent work. At his side, however, are other excellent actors such as Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore or even Henry Travers. The cast's overall performance is good, but that's not what makes us want to see this movie. Deftly directed by Frank Capra, the film has a leisurely pace but doesn't waste a lot of time in exaggerated consideration, doing its best to keep the story going.\n\nTechnically, it's a regular film that makes the most of the resources available at its time, without overshadowing the story it wants to tell, nor going to the director's head, determined to keep the film in a direct and relatively frank record. The black-and-white cinematography is very good and pleasant, and everything was excellently shot, with sharpness and clarity. The editing work was also well done, and the cuts are barely noticeable. The sets and costumes are well done, the dialogues were very well written and there are many memorable moments."

It displays friendship better than any other movie I\u2019ve ever seen, throughout a humorous, eventful, and lovely plot. Every character is incredibly human, and when George wishes to never be born, only to be placed in a reality by his guardian angel where he really wasn\u2019t born, is genius stuff and is an unforgettable part of this story. Tears of joy will come to almost any human with emotions who watches this movie all the way through. The true spirit of Christmas, joy, is truly captured in this story, and I will love this movie when I\u2019m old even more than when I\u2019m young."

We start our journey by analyzing the biggest moments of the character's childhood and adolescence. Identification with him is effortless and satisfying. We then arrive to his adult life and see its ups and downs. The main plot takes a lot of time to germinate. Some parts of the movie are quite long and seem superficial but (no spoiler) the end is definitively worth it.\nI found the guardian angel (who is the character that makes the plot go forward) kind of selfish (because he only accomplishes his mission) and dull.\nActing, and especially James Stewart, is awesome. Each characters has his own face and mood.\nThe main flaw I have to address to this movie is that it is way too much american. Starting from the fact that it clearly is a Christmas movie in which everyone love each other, it compiles the standards of the perfect american life (taking back the job of your father, going to college, meeting the most beautiful girl in here and dance all night, going to university, getting rich  and married and having a lovely family with a lot of children).\nIn the end this movie isn't unpleasant and the morality is really cool."

You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.\n\nHowever, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it."

I've seen one samurai film prior to this.First off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.I thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.Some of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.I wasn't surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film's most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.It's a powerful story, 9/10."

Gladiator delivers where you want it, with big bloody battles in the coliseum and with a convincing and compelling protagonist at the center of it. Good supporting cast and Derek Jacobi as Gracchus was an awesome ode to Roman film lore and something hardcore film geeks will appreciate. Although probably not historically accurate by all accounts, the film is thorough in detail of look and feel of Rome and architectural replication. This movie is light on story and political jockeying that makes other stories of Rome. Instead it focuses and surprises with emotional weight and drama that does not feel out of place. A little lackluster in structure/pacing and cheap acting and writing at times but all in all an epic adventure that shouldn't be missed and is a great rewatch as well. Also, incredible score that will last with you long after the credits.\n\nSetting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax: B+\n\nAudience Engagement (do you feel runtime): No.\n\nTop Genres - Action, Adventure, Drama Fiction/Nonfiction - Historical Fiction Runtime - 2:35\n\nGenre(s) rating -Action: 9 -Adventure: 7 -Drama: 8\n\nGenre Average Score: 8 Directing: 8 Cinematography/lighting: 7 Story/Narrative: 7 Structure: 6 Dialogue: 7 Score(music): 10 Editing: 7 Acting: 6 Characterization: 8 Mise en Sc\u00e8ne/Visual Design: 10 Visual Effects: 8 Costumes/Makeup: 8 Lasting Impact: 8 Originality: 8\n\nOverall: 7.73"

Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox."

I think a lot of fans give it high ratings because of the fight scenes but I found them underwhelming because of the overuse of CGI and fast cuts. On the plus side, the acting is top-notch. It was good to see Richard Harris and Oliver Reed in another historical drama."

It was the cause of a wave of historical films that lasted into the second decade. A few years away from the current diversity, Gladiator again reflected the sandal film and the cultural conception of Hollywood from Rome. The cool and brute force, especially the battle sequence, continued in a similar way in later works by Ridley Scott, which did not make the hero directly but indirectly vulnerable and helped film depth. The film music at Hans-Zimmer is also interesting. While the pictures and story are timeless, the music seems trite and sappy. Also because it sounds the same as in earlier and later films (The Rock, Man of Fire). You'd think the story was too shallow, too simple, too illogical. But it's exactly what makes a good story, simple. A tragic hero, the dark opponent, a game of honor, power, revenge and love. In an arena, in another time, in another world."

Maximus is a brilliant Roman general, the favorite of the old emperor, who wishes to restore the Roman Republic and sees in his successor a project of bloodthirsty tyrant. However, Commodus manages to kill his father and succeed him before he carries out his plans, becoming absolute lord of Rome and orders to kill Maximus and all his family. Trapped and sold into slavery, he becomes a gladiator and, thanks to his training and military experience, quickly becomes one of the best. Finally, he returns to Rome, eager to avenge the tyrannical emperor who stole his life and family.\n\nOk, this movie reminds me a lot of Ben Hur with all this story of revenge and injustice set in the Roman world, but let's talk first of what's good ... directed by Ridley Scott, has a good rhythm, no dead moments, and The director did a pretty good job. The script has an emotive story, with a coherent development that gives us strong and well developed characters. Russell Crowe did a good job and shines in the lead role in one of the films that shaped his career. Joaquin Phoenix also had one of the most remarkable films of his career here, giving his villain a \"rich narcissistic spoiled rich boy\" touch. Richard Harris made a good appearance in what would become one of his last film works. But the real good-bye to seventh art is Oliver Reed, giving life to Proximo, the head of the gladiator school. The prestigious actor passed away during the filming period. In the supporting cast, Djimon Hounsou and Connie Nielsen do a good job.\n\nHowever, the movie is not flawless. The film takes advantage of the names of two Roman emperors who actually existed and succeeded one after another. This turned out to be a problem ... in fact the lives of these two emperors have nothing to do with what this movie shows, and the use of names and contexts raises serious questions about likelihood and historical rigor. There are also some problems of lack of logic and credibility. Regarding the work of the actors, I negatively highlight the bad dialogues of this film, with absolutely clich\u00e9 passages and excessive theatricality.\n\nAt the technical level, the film uses and abuses CGI, the state of the art at the time, to provide us with breathtaking scenarios that bring to our time the exaggerated glory and monumentality of Ancient Rome. It would be hard to do better than this. The deeply epic soundtrack accentuates this monumentality and has become one of the best-selling and most famous soundtracks in contemporary cinema, in all fairness. The special and sound effects highlighted the brutality of the fighting quite well, while the sets and costumes correspond well to what we might expect in an epic movie this season.\n\nUnsurprisingly, and despite all the flaws, the film garnered five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Costume, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects) at the 2001 ceremony."

This blockbuster is what happens when Hollywood occasionally manages to get the big epics right. Filled with larger-than-life characters, gorgeous scenery, impressive set design, and epic storytelling, Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. Gladiator is set in 180 AD, and uses actual historical personages and events for background. The events that transpire in the film are largely fictional, but they blend in well with the known facts. Gladiator has a great deal to recommend it- Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odd. In this case, he is a slave taking on the most powerful man in the world - the Emperor of Rome. Doesn't matter if you're a history buff- this is must watch cinema.(Filmmaking on a grand scale)."

The opening of the movie is inefficient. Ridley Scott tries to combine music with cinematography, but fails. There is nothing good in this movie, everything is made up of ordinary and incomplete sub-narratives that are achieved with a lot of funny trickery. The ups and downs of, for example, the hero of the film have an uncertainty or even false excitement .The family has no definition in the film and is captured by the director's absurd slogans.

The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."

I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film\u2019s message is a little on the nose but I don\u2019t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film\u2019s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film\u2019s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It\u2019s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it\u2019s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I\u2019m using the word tension a lot but that\u2019s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."

Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events.\n\nIf you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can\u2019t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults.  Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up.

            "review": "'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, \"lived-in\" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) \"retro\" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

Regarded as one of the top three greatest horror movies of all time, it\u2019s a definite contender for first place. \u201cAlien\u201d is exceptional for many reasons, but some notable aspects include an incredible visual landscape that truly gives a sense of atmosphere to the plot; a patient and careful pace thru which attention to detail and a true love of the characters evolves, and, most importantly, a flawless script in which every word is carefully chosen. Plot and subplots are developed and each member of the cast is fleshed out. \u201cAlien\u201d sets many standards; not only in moviemaking as a whole, but also in the Horror genre. This film surprises, deceives, concerns and overwhelms. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to find issue with any aspect of \u201cAlien\u201d but one shortcoming is the lack of a proper soundtrack. The monster effects are somewhat dated, but can still stand their ground. When a director truly loves his craft, and his producers are smart enough not to interfere, he will attend to every single aspect of a production. When I say that \u201cAlien\u201d is a perfect movie, I truly mean it: perfection in cinema is defined by an experience of effortless acting, correct dialogue, flawless cinematography and next to no errors in plot and film. Many examples of this perfection exist, and its sad to see the industry half-bake most of its creations. As an example, the sequel to this movie is an immediate and very apparent drop in quality, but is still miles ahead of anything being filmed today. \u201cAlien\u201d is a movie worthy of purchase and repeated viewing, and an example of the wonderful art mankind can achieve."

Scott's approach to filmmaking, with a focus on realism and a \"less is more\" attitude, has helped the film retain its impact even as technology has advanced. The Xenomorph, the film's iconic alien creature, is only present for four minutes, but its presence is felt throughout the film through its use of shadows and off-screen scares. The film began as a graduate student's project, but quickly gained traction and a larger budget after the success of George Lucas' Star Wars. The story follows the seven-member crew of the commercial spacecraft Nostromo as they investigate a transmission from a nearby moon. The film explores themes of commercialism and the value of human life. The performances from the cast, particularly Sigourney Weaver and John Hurt, are noteworthy and the film's iconic \"chestbuster\" scene remains a staple in the horror genre. The film's setting and atmosphere, from the claustrophobic interior of the Nostromo to the vast scale of the alien ship and moon, are expertly crafted and heighten the tension throughout the film. It's a blend of science fiction, horror and thriller, and a must-watch for fans of the genre.\n_______________________________\nAlien de Ridley Scott, la primera entrega de la franquicia, es una obra maestra cinematogr\u00e1fica. El enfoque de Scott para hacer cine, con un enfoque en el realismo y una actitud de \"menos es m\u00e1s\", ha ayudado a que la pel\u00edcula mantenga su impacto incluso cuando la tecnolog\u00eda ha avanzado. El Xenomorfo, la criatura alien\u00edgena ic\u00f3nica de la pel\u00edcula, solo est\u00e1 presente durante cuatro minutos, pero su presencia se siente a lo largo de la pel\u00edcula a trav\u00e9s del uso de sombras y sustos fuera de la pantalla. La pel\u00edcula comenz\u00f3 como un proyecto de estudiante de posgrado, pero r\u00e1pidamente gan\u00f3 fuerza y un mayor presupuesto despu\u00e9s del \u00e9xito de Star Wars de George Lucas. La historia sigue a la tripulaci\u00f3n de siete miembros de la nave espacial comercial Nostromo mientras investigan una transmisi\u00f3n de una luna cercana. La pel\u00edcula explora temas de comercialismo y el valor de la vida humana. Las actuaciones del elenco, en particular de Sigourney Weaver y John Hurt, son dignas de menci\u00f3n y la ic\u00f3nica escena de \"romper el pecho\" de la pel\u00edcula sigue siendo un elemento b\u00e1sico en el g\u00e9nero de terror. El escenario y la atm\u00f3sfera de la pel\u00edcula, desde el claustrof\u00f3bico interior del Nostromo hasta la vasta escala de la nave alien\u00edgena y la luna, est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados por expertos y aumentan la tensi\u00f3n a lo largo de la pel\u00edcula. Es una mezcla de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, terror y suspenso, y una visita obligada para los fan\u00e1ticos del g\u00e9nero."

Around the same time, George Lucas was surprising with his Star Wars, but Ridley Scott showed a similar level. Space is just as mysterious and mysterious, but this mystery can be very costly for one space team. Alien 1979 is very creepy and very violent for its time. Only one scene in the dining room has forever become a cult and recognizable by everyone. The aliens themselves were made very frightening and disgustingly beautiful. It remains now to watch the continuation, in which there may be more Aliens."

Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\n\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\n\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue."

I remember where I was, who I was with and how I felt when I first digested Ridley Scotts masterpiece and is a film I routinely return to.\n\nAlien was reportedly pitched as 'Jaws in space' and follows a rag tag and often disgruntled crew as they are rudely awakened from cryo-sleep to answer a mysterious distress call down on the unknown planet LV-426. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan.\n\nAlien is an exceptionally well crafted, slow burning sci-fi horror that still manages to shock and keep you on the edge of your seat today. The creature design by Giger is still horrifying and the subtle lore that is established serves to build intrigue without detracting from the main 'problem' the crew are facing. Little did 12 year old me know that these questions would be explored in the later made 'Prometheus'.\n\nNotable mentions should go to Jerry Goldsmiths score who's eerily sweeping horns and strings have become synonymous with getting stalked by a xenomorph and to Ian Holm who turns in an excellent performance playing 'Ash' the ships science officer.\n\nAlthough a slow burner to start (the action doesn't really kick off until the hour mark), the atmosphere and the journey you are taken on is worth the investment. This is Ridley Scott on top form and he has arguably rarely been better."

                    "review": "A cult classic that started a franchise, a legacy and is for many the quintessential science fiction / horror movie. In addition it made Sigourney Weaver, Ridley Scott and H. R: Giger world famous. It is the story of the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo. The crew is awakened from stasis by the ships computer as an emergency signal was received from a nearby moon.  After the rocky landing they discover that it is not a ship of human origin and it holds a frightening secret. Here I stop my introduction because of spoilers. The great strength of the movie is the cast including the director and the atmosphere they created. The atmosphere is intense and as the movie progresses it gets better and better as the whole cast is in a grim situation that they want to solve while it might be fully out of their control. I must praise first the director Ridley Scott. He delivered a masterpiece and had a clear vision. There is even a scene were he did not told the actors about a surprise to get a more realistic and shocked performance (Everyone who saw the movie will immediately know the scene I described here spoiler free). Even if this was made up later it is believable as he clearly knows what he wanted and what worked in this movie. Then there are the actors. Let start with Sigourney Weaver whose career jump-started with this movie. She is the star of the movie and delivers a flawless performance. Tom Skerrit as captain Dallas is also good and only in this movie because of Ridley Scott (and a higher budget). The rest of the cast is also great and I think Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and especially Ian Holm should be mentioned here and praised for their performance. All in all they create an atmosphere that is so immersive that you forget that it is a movie. Then I must also talk about H. R. Giger and his effects. He became a legend and he deserved respect. In short he made a career and a lot of money out of nightmares and his imagination. His special effects were stellar and did not fail to deliver. I almost forgot the sets. Again they create a realistic and believable atmosphere. Just mundane space travel as it would look if it became common business and alien looking structures that are equally believable. Then there is the score that enhance the atmosphere. It is so good that you will not notice its effects that you will experience (This is not a critique and meant positive). I have nothing negative to say here and might only warn you about 1 scene that is maybe to shocking for some even if its widely know by now. When the crew takes a meal after a crewman recovered be prepared for the worst. Overall this is a masterpiece and cult classic. Got a rightful place in movie history and is still as good now as back then."

Gr\u00e1ficamente es todo un espect\u00e1culo, efectos especiales impresionantes, escenarios tan detallados que se ven bien a dia de hoy, y un muy buen uso de las luces. Es incre\u00edble que una pel\u00edcula actuada tan vieja (1979) pueda envejecer tan bien, salvo la ultima escena en la que muestran el cuerpo completo del alien, que si se nota que la trabajaron muy poco, pero todo lo dem\u00e1s es incre\u00edble. Tambi\u00e9n debo destacar la atm\u00f3sfera, que si bien en parte juega en contra (ya dir\u00e9 luego porque), la pel\u00edcula mantiene muy bien ese nivel de tensi\u00f3n, sumado a que hay pocos jumpscares, realmente no te los esperas, y en cierta medida reduce as\u00ed las situaciones cliches. Pero ahora a hablar de los puntos negativos. Y es que si bien dije que la atmosfera en cierta medida juega a favor, esto es a costa de dejar muy poco desarrollo de personajes y mantener muchas secciones con solo tensi\u00f3n y nada mas. En parte sent\u00ed que la pel\u00edcula se estaba alargando artificialmente. La pel\u00edcula dura 2 horas, y debo decir que la primera media hora la sent\u00ed muy de relleno. Si bien algunos podr\u00edan contraargumentar que la pel\u00edcula intenta transmitir tension y suspenso (que en parte lo hace), esto es asi hasta el final, y a costa de no dar una historia llamativa, ni explicarnos cosas como el origen del alien o las verdaderas intenciones de la compa\u00f1\u00eda con hallar el descubrimiento (por dar un ejemplo). Realmente la historia nunca se explota, es otra de esas pel\u00edculas de terror que solo buscan atm\u00f3sfera, pero por tener solo atm\u00f3sfera, al menos a mi, no van a lograr captar mi atenci\u00f3n, quiero una buena historia tambi\u00e9n, y desgraciadamente muy pocas de su genero lo han logrado. Llega a tener varios cliches, incluso para su tiempo y algunos son muy predecibles, los personajes a veces act\u00faan como tontos y, en resumen, se siente como la t\u00edpica pel\u00edcula thriller en la casa, solo que esta vez con tem\u00e1tica futurista. No es que haya envejecido mal, simplemente es aburrida de ver y con un mont\u00f3n de cosas que podr\u00edan haberse explorado y explotado."

But, man, there's no boundary line to art.\" Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art\"Beautiful\" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say \"good job\" but rather \"thank you\", to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle\ufeff for sharing his vision."

Much like the turbulent tempos of its jazz-infused soundtrack, this film catapults the audience into the cutthroat world of music education, leaving them emotionally bruised and exhilarated.Damien Chazelle, the conductor of this chaotic symphony, deserves applause for crafting a narrative that transcends the mere confines of a music school drama. J.K. Simmons delivers a tour de force performance as Terence Fletcher, a maestro of emotional manipulation and sadistic pedagogy. His relentless pursuit of excellence borders on the sadomasochistic, making you question whether you're witnessing a music class or a psychological **** protagonist, Andrew Neiman, played with both vulnerability and determination by Miles Teller, is a symphony of ambition and self-destruction. The film masterfully explores the thin line between mentorship and abuse, leaving you questioning the cost of **** cinematography, reminiscent of a frenetic drum solo, captures the intensity of each scene. The use of shadows and close-ups reflects the inner turmoil of the characters, creating a visual crescendo that parallels the musical **** the credits roll, you're left contemplating the blurred boundaries between passion and obsession, genius and madness. \"Whiplash\" is not just a film; it's a visceral experience that resonates long after the final note. In a world where mediocrity often takes center stage, this cinematic gem serves as a relentless reminder that true artistry demands sacrifice, sometimes at the expense of one's sanity. Bravo, Chazelle, for orchestrating a symphony of brilliance and madness that strikes a dissonant chord in the symphony of life."

This feature is so poetic, so filled with both fast-paced musical action and floating moments of eloquent silence.\nThe plot is kind of simple but is brought in a particular way which keeps us on our toes. The pace of events is a bit jerky especially during the last quarter of the movie but it paradoxically compiles the most precious gems of it.\nNo spoil but the last scene is an unavoidable masterpiece. I would say the success of 'Whiplash' especially reside in the way it managed to popularise very theoritical concepts and moves. Despite all that, some subplots as social relations and Andrew's dad presence should have been more investigated in my opinion. Even if not exploring them also makes Andrew's choices more touching and engaging.\nDefinitely deserves its 'Metacritic Must See' label."

Simmons gives a commanding performance as well as Miles Teller.\n\nVery well shot, edited, acted and designed; with a fresh take on old ideas. The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing **** on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen.\n\nAs for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one."

The characters in this movie are the main reason why you\u2019ll want to watch this. Terrance Fletcher (played by J.K Simmons) is a psychopathic teacher who is manipulative and very interesting to watch.\nMy only small complaint is the pacing of the movie it starts off slow then speeds up a lot then goes slow again then speeds up a little bit. For a movie like this I believe they could have been a bit more consistent.\nMy favourite part of the movie is the final scene. I don\u2019t want to spoil it, because it is by far in my opinion one of the best scenes that we have seen in movies this past decade. Something everyone should see.\nOverall a solid must watch movie. :)"

We are provided with an insight into the life of Andrew Neiman, an arrogant drummer who becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming the greatest drummer of all time. The movie shows how much he is willing to sacrifice, as we see him push personal relationships and needs aside in pursuit of this unrealistic dream. Its sickening to see someone slowly loose touch with their own reality as they fall into a deep obsession with their dream, and I though it was handled brilliantly. However, what really makes this movie unique is Andrews relationship with the character Terence Fletcher, the abusive, ruthlessly harsh band conductor.\nNot only does this character act as a representation of the dark reality of the professional music world, but also as a representation of just how far Andrew is willing to go to become the greatest drummer in the world. Time and time again, we see Fletcher verbally, and physically, abuse Andrew, threaten and gas light him and push his physical limits as a drummer beyond a reasonable amount. Yet, after all this, we see Andrew continue to come back to fletcher, because he believes that he is the key to becoming a world famous musician. Just as Fletcher highlights Andrews obsessive nature, Andrews reaction to Fletchers character outlines his harsh nature. These two characters complement each other really well, and their dynamic in this film was easily the best part of it. Over the duration of the film, we see Fletchers unhealthy, distorted view of music slowly rub off onto Andrew, until it reaches a point where it becomes harder and harder for the viewer to find differences between these two characters. These powerful, though provoking themes explored within the film are incredibly engaging and really enjoyable to watch. I would also like to mention that the cinematography of this film is outstanding. There wasn\u2019t a single moment in the film where the cinematography fell shot, because every single shot is framed with such precision and intent, and it was amazing to see the camera work for this film. Quick cuts and intense pans and zooms are used to emulate the sporadic nature of the drum kit, and the film does an excellent job of having this instrument drive certain scenes of the film. Sequentially, the acting in this film is unbelievable. Whilst Miles Teller does a fantastic job of bringing a high level of practicality to his role with his drumming, it is J. K. Simmons who steals the show, providing a hyper realistic and intense acting performance.\nWhiplash is a fantastic movie because of its ability to keep the viewer engaged. Every scene with Andrew and Fletcher is like watching a horror movie, but the viewer is always left wanting to see more of these two characters together. This film is such a fantastic piece of art that has the viewer emotionally invested within its story, and I would highly recommend this movie."

            "reviewer": "Flagrant-BaronessaDec 27, 2006",
            "review": "Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act \u0096 the prestige \u0096 is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show \u0096 in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd \u0096 is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige'\u0096 of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a \"gotcha\"-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson \u0096 always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point) \u0096 performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10"

I will admit, I have seen this film quite a few times (I will tell you why later), and the more I watch this film the more I catch on to the little details. I mean (come on) this film has both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as the main characters. The best part is they go head-to-head against each other (I know what your thinking, this film has both Batman and Wolverine... mind blown). Let me explain, this film is based in the late 1890's (possibly early 1900's, I can never really tell) in London, England as two magicians struggle against each other to give their audiences \"the greatest\" magic trick in the world. These two magicians are locked in a fierce rivalry against each other to the point were it affects the people around them. Each moment when one magician thinks he has the upper hand the tables turn to leave that magician only empty handed. Of course, being that this film is a Christopher Nolan flick, a bigger plot emerges that eventually puts a stop to this epic rivalry.\n\nBesides the fact that this film is fun and interesting to watch, to understand this story completely you must watch this film again and again. This film is not The Matrix confusing, but in this film, every single detail is important to the story. It took me a few times to watch this film just to understand the ending. The performances of each of the actors and actresses is excellent, especially Christian Bale. This film must be one of his better films other than the Dark Knight series of course. This film also features several other familiar faces that the audience would appreciate. Not only does this film have the best actors in its corner, but a strong story line that carries this film all the way to the end. This film is one of best films about an individual's attempt to grasp the impossible and to stay ahead of his competition. The characters will soon discover that their pursuit for the impossible has taken them down a path that was unintended by each party.\n\nWhenever I get an opportunity, I always make time to watch this film at least once a year. Nowadays, it doesn't seem like many people watch or even talk about this film. Which is a shame because this film is a good film, even better than films I have seen this year. If this film is not a classic now it should be in the future. Personally, I could watch this film at any time in the day, and it will still be good. Anyway, if you love films with plot twists, drama, rivalry, intense moments, and mystery then you will love this film.\n\nIn summary, this film is one of my personal favorites for a reason and that is because this film is the best. I recommend this film to anybody just looking for a solid film."

Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.\n\nWas also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.\n\nHowever, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.\n\nThe story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.\n\nFine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.\n\nOverall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox."

Thus begins a cruel game between the two men about who is the best and the rivalry will gradually turn into obsession.\nHere Nolan stages a great direction, with tight and precise camera movements, fantastic shots and also the script which is usually one of his weak points turns out to be solid.

I have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet; and now it was this film's turn. At first I was a bit skeptical of watching it because of how complicated Nolan's films are, and on top of it this one is about magicians. So that would be even more confusing. After having seen Tenet I was overestimating this film. It's nothing as complicated (though it is fairly so), and that's for a good thing.\n\nIt's funny there are three actors in this film who also played superheroes movies - Christian Bale (Batman in TDK Trilogy), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in X-Men), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow in MCU), and out of them Scarlett Johansson hadn't even come up as Black Widow yet. And since those are the only roles I have previously seen them, it was a bit weird seeing them do basic, method acting. The only one I had seen before do multiple roles is Michael Caine (Alfred in TDK trilogy), but he's in every Nolan film I've ever watched so he doesn't count. And all their acting was actually pretty convincing.\n\nThe story is what mainly carries this film. There are two magicians who have two completely different ideas about magic. Borden is more of someone who believes in making his life more devoted towards magic, while Angier is someone who believes the charm of magic is more based on presentation. Both the magicians hold grudges against each other due to an accident which happened in the past, which is the reason they are constantly trying to outdo each other.\n\nSeeing this film I got to learn so many magic tricks that I otherwise used to dismiss as simply being some complicated trick my tiny brain is too weak to understand. My take from this, especially from Alfred Borden, was that to understand how magic works, we have to go to the absolute basics. How something is happening, how we can convince the audience that we are doing what they are thinking and how we can do it so smoothly that no one suspects a thing.\n\nThis is something that we can say about science too, which was shown here by Nikola Tesla - what do you think is responsible behind what you see? If Edison had tried thinking it this way instead of trying to get to Tesla, he could have been considered just about as respectable while Tesla would have never been as famous as he is today. Though I didn't quite understand how exactly the whole cloning using electricity thing worked, I guess some things are better left to the viewer's imagination. The way Angier described how it feels to be cloned also left me in my imagination - what would happen if I am cloned with all the memories intact? Which one of us will be me?\n\nForget The Dark Knight trilogy, now this is my favourite film by Christopher Nolan. I only learnt about Hollywood movies a few years ago, which absolutely explains why I never knew about this film. But now that I do, I'm going to recommend everyone to see it once. Seeing all the tricks and, like I mentioned above, trying to figure out how to deduct an act, I also felt like becoming a magician after watching this film."

Adapted from Christopher Priest's novel of the same name, by the Nolan brothers, this remains about a magic in that very sense. That you are hooked and wowed at the end of the show, till it's big reveal. The film is about a two friends-turned-rival magicians who loses themselves and their loved ones in order to prove the superiority over each other.\n\nAnd the film walks for that unsaid scoreboard mentality for the most part of the film. Grabbing points by excelling or cheating, this mano-y-mano aspect of the storyline deteriorates very quickly when bigger themes like art, science, philosophy and ethics dive in. The clash between art and science is what fascinated me the most, especially after the film started accounting in, the infamous feud between Tesla and Edison.\n\nOften in a film that deals with parallel characters going awry and coming home, the film cheapens its content in latter stages by manipulating the audience emotionally. But the film dodges this bullet by wisely never revealing the hand that helps us in surviving this film. Empathy is never installed forcibly and even when for a brief period in its last act, you feel the film going soft on the characters, it actually turns the tables by revealing information that is always said to be hidden and not reversing the roles of any elements. This underrated genius often goes unmentioned, but it requires a closer and a second look. Nolan's film's malleability has been arctic over the ages. Not stiff, nor cold, but moody. To a degree that you will bow down to its celebratory behavior and PG-13 language. Something you don't see nowadays."

I love the unconventional (and Nolan-esque) storytelling, which shifts back and forth between the past and the present. I love Christian bale, who makes one of his finest performances here (I can't decide if this is his best performance or the one in American Psycho). I love how they show you how some of the illusions are performed and the trick STILL feel like true magic.\n\nAnd no, I'm not forgetting the other actors. The performances are all wonderful. Hugh Jackman is never bad in anything he is in, and The Prestige is no exception. I also love the small part David Bowie plays in the movie - a shame we didn't get to see more of him on the silver screen before his passing.\n\nThis is no action movie filled with magic trick, like the equally brilliant Now You See Me. No, The Prestige is a mystery film, and a great one at that. The thrills of this film are contained within the magic, the competition between two illusionist in love. The storytelling has a nice flow to it, and the movie feels compelling from the beginning to the end. And just when you think you've figured it all out, the Nolan brothers throw in a final twist and shake it all up again! It makes the entire film itself feel like one, massive magic trick."

                    "review": "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. The Batman films and Inception might be what popularized Nolan, but, it's the films like Following, Memento and The Prestige that made me like him in the way I do. .\n.\nGood : This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story, and with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character (by which, here, I mean obsession) development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a **** throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his apparently wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. .\n.\nConclusion : All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. Rating. .\n.\nScore : absolute 10/10\nGrade : A+"

My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear \"Gimme Shelter\" again, but \"Comfortably Numb\" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."

It's got everything I want in a movie: great script, terrific performances, riveting plot, clear direction, precise editing, and just a full and complete package of a movie experience. I really think this movie is peak Scorsese and everyone else involved but if anyone disagrees and says other Scorsese movies are better, it's hard to disagree since the man turns out masterpiece after masterpiece. This one just hits every note I could hope for and easily a Best Picture-worthy film. Yes, Scorsese should've probably gotten that Oscar long ago but even if he did, The Departed deserves all the praise it received and more! P.S. Check out Infernal Affairs too. That's also excellent!"

The writing, directing, acting and cast are all phenomenal and make every second of this movie enjoyable. This is a gangster-crime drama that\u2019s smart, effective and truly a Martin Scorsese movie. From start to finish the film flows incredibly well and is very engaging and entertaining to watch. The story and plot are very interesting and creative and the way that both are executed is also fantastic. The A-list cast of this film feels like it\u2019s out of a dream: Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Vera Farmiga, and so many others. The movie doesn\u2019t squander any of them and Scorsese does a great job of capitalizing on the chemistry these actors have and making great use of them in general. The dialogue is also great; I love that this movie doesn\u2019t hold back on the cursing and vulgar language which makes so many scenes incredibly entertaining in a way that isn\u2019t over the top. It also adds a lot of humor to the movie which is nice because so much of this movie is serious, which is appropriate of it\u2019s genre. The performances from every cast member are superb; they deliver all their lines perfectly and have some cool accents that amplify a lot of scenes, and overall contribute a lot to how good this movie is. What I like the most about The Departed is how it doesn\u2019t hold back on any fronts: language, violence, death and other themes that are core to the gangster-crime drama. It goes full force with all these things to make this movie as realistic as possible and deliver in every way that it needs to, and this works very well towards making the movie successful. I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t a movie for kids and you need to be mature and prepared for a lot of what you\u2019ll see. This is really an adult movie. The end is also great: it makes everything culminate and wrap up perfectly which allows the movie to conclude on a satisfying and appropriate note. The Departed is well-worthy of the Academy award for Best Picture and I\u2019m glad that it won it cause this is a movie that you need to see whether you\u2019re into filmmaking or not. I\u2019ve seen this film twice and I could watch it again and still have a lot of fun with it. The Departed is an outstanding movie and is a must-see for viewers who are into a variety of different genres since The Departed is a mix of genres and incorporates them all beautifully into it\u2019s core premise."

At the center of this movie is a struggle between undercover cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) and sergeant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon). Sullivan, an affiliate of local mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson), is sent to infiltrate the police force. Costigan is sent by the force to infiltrate Costello's mob. When each realizes that they're being pursued by the other, a thrilling game of cat and mouse plays out between the two. The action throughout the filming is enthralling, and the ending is sensational. Despite the strong storyline, the film wouldn't be what it is without the cast. Wahlberg, DiCaprio, and Nicholson are the greatest standouts in such a star-studded cast. While it's not at the level of Goodfellas (few movies are), The Departed is definitely a gem in the crime genre."

It is actually a remake to the film, Infernal Affairs from Hong Kong which is something I did not know. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg have acted and played really good characters in this along with the other cast. Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan who wants to be a cop but is recruited by the captain and the staff sergeant to go undercover because he's no cop just like what he said \"You're no f**king cop!\" Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan who becomes a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police as he is still working for Costello. I've already told you Jack Nicholson as the mobster so I'll move on. Mark Wahlberg as Sgt. Sean Dignam who is willing to take down Costello with his fellow officers and he and Queenan help Costigan give them information about what Costello's doing. The film is really well done. I love it with it's great writing, acting especially with Jack Nicholson who I think steals the show and directing from my favourite director Martin Scorsese. Now there are a few other films with Leonardo DiCaprio collaborating with Martin Scorsese I still need to see, like Gangs of New York, The Aviator and Shutter Island. I've already seen The Wolf of Wall Street. The Departed is a great fantastic crime gangster film and a great remake to the Hong Kong film. He has done it again. He's the best director there is to be thinking about whenever you think of gangster flicks. He does an incredible job directing all of his films especially collaborating with the editor Thelma Schoonmaker who I assume she is known for frequently working with Martin Scorsese and I just watched the BAFTA Awards show the other day. The speech she said is so beautiful I couldn't believe what I've just witnessed. So as it is, this movie is a masterpiece. Give it a watch and see if it interests you enough."

The bad guy doesn't really feel like a bad guy, but more like some creepy grandpa. Matt Damon his acting is alright, though the character itself just isn't very interesting.

Right from the start it's obvious that Scorsese was lazily reworking much of the Goodfellas formula, using Jack Nicholson as the foundation character, somewhat more like Pesci than De Niro though - as he isn't likeable - and even less mentally stable. As the story evolves, Nicholson's character's personality quickly becomes a very poorly researched (unresearched) mixture of bipolar, schizophrenic, and psychotic mental illnesses - poorly, and confusingly portrayed by Nicholson, no thanks to Scorsese's lack of help and direction (because Scorsese clearly only read the tabloid version of these mental illnesses). Another problem with Scorsese lazily dialing in his direction and reworking the Goodfellas formula is that the era the film's set in is a bizarre mix of '70s to modern day, but with little actually changes to the time frame. The pacing and structure of the film is so poor that when the main plot point occurs in the middle of the film you're left confused, thinking, \"Is this really the moment the plot was leading up to, or is it just more build-up.\" But no, the main event really is halfway through the film and very anticlimactic. As, with most directors, Scorsese isn't the brightest of individuals so there's plenty of plot holes or illogical elements for you to force yourself to ignore, too. The second half of the film feels more like it should've been the first half's sequel - resultantly, in effect, seeming like two weak films being glued together. The first half is too short and the second half is too long, leaving you asking yourself, \"Didn't the film end an hour ago?\" Also, the second half reveals and exploits the extremely 'long game' played by one of the mobsters, which is obviously completely ridiculous - they don't just bribe people instead, still? Outside of Nicholson's poor and unbelievable performance, most other actors do a good job, especially DiCaprio. Mark Wahlberg, however, despite looking a bit out of place, is one of the few likeable characters. The first half of 'The Departed' is like a heist movie, and the second half is a vendetta, which features so many over the top, shock value, killings it's clearly ripping off 'The Godfather' in the style of 'To Live And Die In L.A.' To Live And Die In LA, despite the low production values, is far superior to this mess, plus it has an authentic retro ('80s) setting and soundtrack. Alternatively, just re-watch Goodfellas or the first two Godfather films instead. Overrated, weak reworking of the Goodfellas formula, with terrible structure, and lazy direction. 2/10* *It's probably a 4, but I'm trying to make up for all the \"10/10!!!!!1\" uncultured reviewers."

    "Django Unchained": {
        "featured-review": {
            "tagline": "Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish",
            "reviewer": "DonFishiesDec 23, 2012",
            "review": "I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino \u2013 he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object \u2013 but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10."

Though a western film, Django isn't a cowboy hero, rather a free slave anti-hero. He's neither good nor bad, but is a steadfast individual who ends up learning a whole lot from the German bounty hunter who freed him. The only thing he wants back is his beloved wife, but ends up facing brutal violence, harsh negotiating, and formidable plantation owners. The fiery revenge in Django's attitude throughout the film gives the feeling that he might explode at any given second, yet he somehow fastens it to a leash. He is an attentive, patient, yet zealous man slowly making his way from the bottom to the top. The use of wide angle filming in this movie captures every bit of vivid landscape imaginable in 19th century Texas, giving the viewers a deeper appreciation for Tarantino's masterful filming in which he habitually displays. Really can't say much more than this. Just watch it now."

Quinten takes his blood-spattered historical tent show on the road, putting down stakes in Antebellum Dixieland. Not technically a \"Basterds\" prequel, \"Django\" stems from a similar impulse, to reframe and rewrite American history in boldly absurd strokes. \"Inglorious Basterds\" is an exceptional film, but \"Django Unchained\" surpasses its predecessor, and then some.\n\nThe movie opens in 1858 Texas with the unorthodox purchase of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), by a dentist-turned-bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz). Since Schultz doesn't believe in slavery, he soon frees Django and the two become partners in Schultz's business. After a profitable winter, they head to Mississippi where their goal is to locate Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). When they succeed, they find an excuse to be invited to the plantation where she is being held. There, they are guests of the mansion's master, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), where their act bamboozles everyone except Candie's personal slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who smells a rat the moment he sets eyes on Django.\n\nWhen Tarantino first introduces audiences to the two characters we'll come to embrace and respect, it's while Django (Foxx) is chained up to other slaves as they march slowly in the dark in the middle of nowhere. Dr. Schultz arrives playing the role of a dentist in a scene that's close to being as perfectly written and delivered as Waltz' farmhouse scene from \u201cBasterds,\u201d freeing Django and thus begins a reluctant partnership. What starts as an uneasy alliance in which one side holds all the power, transforms over the course of the movie into one in which the unlikely pair become partners and friends. Delivering this transformation along with character development, Tarantino is at his screenwriting best.\n\nThere is not a single misstep by any of the \u201cUnchained\u201d cast. Led by Foxx as a slave-turned-bounty-hunter, and Waltz as a man with more layers than initially revealed, this ensemble is a perfectly cast with everyone at the top of their games. \u201cDjango\u201d is an absolute must-see for Tarantino fans, but it's not necessary to be into either Tarantino or just Westerns to be fully entertained. There are many notable cameos: Don Johnson (small part), Jonah Hill, Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, and Franco Nero (who played the lead character in the unrelated 1966 film, Django).\n\nTarantino is one of the few filmmakers that seamlessly and successfully merges style with substance. He is a creature of cinema, unashamedly standing on the shoulders of greats, forging new meaning out of the universal cultural experiences. That is why as far as I'm concerned \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d is one of the best of 2012"

The cast consists of Jamie Foxx, Christopher Waltz Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L Jackson, and other amazing actors and is set in the mid 1800s. Django, a slave is rescued one day by Doctor Schultz from the horrors of slavery to assist him in a bounty hunting mission. After Django helps Doctor Schultz, Doctor Schultz promises to reunite young Django with his wife who was sold to another slave owner along time ago. What follows is more than an hour of amazing screenplay. First off, the acting is incredibly solid and some of the best I have ever seen. Waltz and Jamie are like butter and bread in this film and are incredible and watching them on the screen together is like magic. The music, the acting and incredible journey make this one of Tarintinos best films ever. Dare I say one of the best movies EVER. Period. Highly recommended."

                    "review": "I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.\n\nThe plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help ****, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.\n\nThe film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.\n\nThe main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in \"Inglorious ****\" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.\n\nTechnically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from \"Django\" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre."

            "reviewer": "ConkerBFD91Feb 18, 2008",
            "review": "Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or \"hit men\". They're the standard \"badass\" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). L\u00e9on, however, flips this clich\u00e9 on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.L\u00e9on begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for L\u00e9on, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. L\u00e9on is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, L\u00e9on also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of L\u00e9on is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, L\u00e9on is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994."

Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield.

Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r\n\r\nWhat I Personally Liked About \"The Professional\":\r\nMuch of the greatness found in this film rests squarely on the shoulders of its actors. Residing on the top rung of that ladder of greatness is none other than Gary Oldman. This guy has turned in so many brilliant performances over the years that it's hard to believe he's only been nominated for an Academy Award ONCE! Between the performance he gives in this film and the performance he gave in \"Immortal Beloved\" (also released in 1994), he should have easily been nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars that year. Newcomer Natalie Portman also turned in a stellar performance as well. You can (almost) always tell whether or not a child actor has what it takes to make it in the business and there wasn't even the slightest shadow of a doubt that Natalie was going to have a solid career. She displays an ability that would be rare coming from a thirty-year veteran, which makes it all the more startling due to the fact that this was Natalie's feature debut. Technically the star of the film, Jean Reno, takes third tier in the acting department. His quiet killing grace and awkward social interactions are spot-on and fill his character with an undeniable charm not usually found in silver screen assassins. There are a few moments of levity peppered throughout Luc Besson's screenplay which help to keep some of the weight of this dark subject material from crushing its viewers. The cinematography from Thierry Arbogast is also a very nice touch. He keeps the visuals feeling wide and free, even in the most confining of spaces (such as hallways, stairwells, small apartment rooms, etc.) which is where much of the film takes place.\r\n\r\nWhat I Personally Disliked About \"The Professional\":\r\nThere are a few slightly irritating drawbacks in the movie (mostly centered around the odd editing choices and certain selections from Eric Serra's score mid way through the presentation), however they are not annoying enough to damage the overall effect of the film.\r\n\r\nMy Overall Impression of \"The Professional\":\r\nBesson has been hit or miss, in my eyes, since the start of his directorial career. \"The Professional\" certainly qualifies as one of the former. All of the right bullets hit all of the right targets, making this one of the brighter dramatic showcases of its year (and possibly of its decade)."

                    "review": "The career aspirations of Mathilda (Natalie Portman) aren't those of the average 12-year old girl. Instead of wanting to be a doctor, fashion model, teacher, lawyer, or nuclear physicist, Mathilda has decided to follow in the footsteps of her best friend, surrogate father, and protector, Leon (Jean Reno). The only problem is that Leon is a \"cleaner\" -- a professional hit man (\"Cool\" is her one-word response when she learns this tidbit of information).\r\n\r\nMathilda comes from a very dysfunctional family. Her father is a drug dealer, his wife (played by Ellen Greene in a wig and performance that strongly recall images of Little Shop of Horrors' Audrey) despises her, and her half-sister enjoys beating her up. Mathilda's chief pleasure is hanging out in her New York City tenement building's stairwell, smoking cigarettes.\r\n\r\nOne day, a crooked cop (played with typical over-the-top exuberance by Gary Oldman) decides to have Mathilda's whole family exterminated. When she arrives home to find them slaughtered, she goes to Leon, who lives down the hall, for help. Although he's at first reluctant to open his door to her, once he does, she worms her way into both his life and his heart. And she's not some wide-eyed innocent; her desire to learn about killing is fueled by the need to exact bloody revenge for her little brother's murder (she could care less about the other family members).\r\n\r\nIn La Femme Nikita, writer/director Luc Besson proved his capability of putting as much octane and adrenaline into a thriller as any American director while keeping his formula uniquely non-Hollywood. Much the same is true of The Professional, which has sequences to rival those of Speed for white-knuckle excitement - not to mention a plot that's equally as preposterous.\r\n\r\nThe real strength of The Professional, however, is the central relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Although not well-founded in reality, these two characters mesh nicely. Despite an occasional low-key hint of sexual attraction, this is basically a father/daughter or mentor/apprentice relationship. There's nothing unique about a young girl melting the heart of a hardened loner except the manner in which Besson approaches the theme.\r\n\r\nJean Reno, essentially reprising his \"cleaner\" role from Nikita (where he was called Victor), plays his character with a perpetual deadpan (except when he lampoons John Wayne). He does more with mannerisms and body language than with facial expressions, and the closer he is drawn to Mathilda, the more uncomfortable he appears.\r\n\r\nThe less traditional role belongs to an impressive Natalie Portman, yet another member of the highly-talented, recent group of youthful actors. Portman portrays a victim of society's ills, the perfect example of innocence corrupted. There are likely some viewers who will be disturbed by Mathilda's predilection for profanity.\r\n\r\nBecause of the non-American flavor brought to this film by Besson, The Professional is anything but typical fare. It is stylish, darkly humorous, and almost artsy in its approach to the genre. Nevertheless, it delivers what viewers want from any thriller: lots of action. With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAt one point, Leon comments to an attentive Mathilda that \"the closer you get to being a pro, the closer you can get to the client.\" Through the intimacy of the link forged by Besson with his audience, there's no doubt that he's as much the consummate professional as his implacable title character."

Not as good as Oldman, but they were no slouches either. For this one, the few actiony sequences were well done and very exciting and the thriller element was certainly there as the thrills, at times, really left you on the edge of your seat. The film is also very heartwarming as both Leon and Mathilda are in tough spots and really fill the holes in one another's hearts. At times, it can be a little creepy, but for the most part, their father-daughter esque relationship is charming, even if a bit odd to many.

Wholly inappropriate but bot surprising coming from Luc Besson, an equally troubled man who met his first wife when she was also TWELVE but dated at 15, impregnated anr gives birth to his child at the age of 16. To say this movie is a mirror to his child grooming is  ot an exaggeration. The performances are very good, but the subject matter of a March/December romance is vile and reprehensible. To glorify the grooming of children or sexualize them and call it art is morally despicable. It is beyond \u201ccringey\u201d as Portman herself recently commented. It could have been a great flick had Besson a decent bone in his body. But his predilection for underaged girls, much like Polanski, makes this movie a disturbing spectacle. Gross. Just GROSS."

The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.\nOne of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."

The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to ****, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The funny, adventurous time-traveling story is one that has been showered with popularity due to writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale\u2019s incredible storytelling. Their capability to show a new and improved concept when dealing with the popular time-traveling genre and making it memorable and exciting is what attains the sci-fi fanatic\u2019s attention. Zemeckis directing truly shines in Back to the Future; his camera work allows the movie to be an intriguing and entertaining film for the younger audience, contrasting the use of fast-paced action sequences and calm, smooth romantic sequences and with it, latch the audience further with the storyline, characters, and memorable scenes to create an unforgettable first impression. The cast\u2019s ability to portray believable characters that\u2019ll make the audience love and connect with them is exactly what Back to the Future achieves. Michael J. Fox\u2019s interpretation of Marty\u2019s charm and juvenility and Christopher Lloyd\u2019s portrayal of Doc Brown\u2019s funny, comedic, and science freak self fulfill the audience\u2019s desire for a relatable, comedy movie that has scientific fiction sprinkled all around it. Many ingredients go into the creation of good filmmaking, but the Back to the Future film truly goes up and beyond in its decision of screenwriting, directing, and cast. Sci-fi, comedy, and time-traveling fanatics would undoubtedly leave a place in their hearts for this film as it checks off every box in their genre of amazing filmmaking."

Also for many this is one of the quintessential time travel movies and science fiction comedy. The strengths are the great cast, the good immersive story and that it has nearly a perfect pacing / build up. At the time of writing it is over 35 years old and still works for new and old viewers. It is the story of the teenager Marty McFly who comes from a struggling family with many problems. One night he meets Dr. Emmet Brown on a parking lot who claims to be his friend. There he shows him his newest invention which is a time machine he build into / with a modified DeLorean car. Sidenote: The DeLorean motor company was an American car manufacturer which got bankrupt in 1982. They are remembered for the gull wing doors and for this movie. In short their name entered pop culture history while they had no commercial success. Back to the movie. After some events I wont spoil Marty is stuck in the past on 05.11.1955 and has no way to return back to his time without help (To be precise he is technically home ). However this is not his biggest problem as time travel has consequences too or will have if you don't act carefully. I am vague here to not spoil the story. It has a great pacing, good twist and the actors enhance this with their performance. I rewatched this movie countless times and it has still nostalgic value. The movie has something everybody can relate to. Lets start with the great cast. This is Michael J. Fox signature role as Marty McFly and he is universally liked if not loved. It is such a natural performance that wins you over immediately. I cant picture anyone else in this role. Same goes for Christoper Loyd as Doc Brown. He nails the role of eccentric scientist. These 2 are perfectly for this movie and became pop culture legends in these roles. It stops not here as we get Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen. He is one of the favorite bad guys in cinema and his performance is just great. I will praise Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover for their performance but wont spoil much. For all of these the movies became one of their most well know performances. I say we got a great cast and no missteps. Then I want to point out the special effect. It is amazing how good it looked back then. ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are just the masters of special effects and also the gold standard. Even today it would be acceptable and I have seen worse from much newer movies. They got the look of 1955 right or the expectations. Everything looks and feels right. I must of cause talk about the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. The \u201cBack to the Future\u201d theme is universally know but \u201cThe Power of Love\u201d became a timeless classic too. It is even played today in the radio and often reaches top positions in best movie songs. The rest is also excellent and worth buying. Before I forget it I must also praise director Robert Zemeckis who is in general not recognized enough for his works. Lastly I want to address the well done humor. They get the mixture of humor and seriousness right. Nothing harms the other and you will be entertained greatly. Overall this became rightfully a classic and started a successful franchise (It has no weak movies. Naming part 3 weak is nitpicking at best). It is the kind of movie that you will rewatch from time to time and have fond memories off. Fully recommend it as it is pop culture history."

As the film became the 30th Anniversary in 2015, the three films became a 30th Anniversary Trilogy celebrating the release of the first film which gained massive praise from critics and audience. Yes, I watched the whole trilogy in one day, believe or not, but I'm going to get these two later until I'm finished with the first film. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back in time from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. Dr. Emmett Brown aka. Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, his friend and the inventor of the time-traveling DeLorean automobile, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. OK, so what people love  about this film that has sense nowadays that I know this is a popular film and definitely the most popular Back to the Future film out of the trilogy. I love the story for what they've achieved with the first act where the story of the characters saying about what happened back in 1955 and when Marty is traveled in that year it goes what they usually do but not for Marty McFly 'cause he got hit by a car instead of George and now Lorraine, played by Lea Thompson, who now has the hots for him. Yeah, kinda weird while you think about it. For what I didn't know is that this film is used in pop culture such as what is \"Rick and Morty\" and that's all I know about that. I love the characters in which Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd plays along with the other actors. They both play fan favourite characters like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is a typical teenager who accidentally went back in time in 1955 and he wants to get back in the year 1985. From what I heard that Michael J. Fox has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which kinda **** but he did continued work. Christopher Lloyd for many people know as an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown aka. \"Doc\" who built the time machine made from the DeLorean and is my favourite character of the film. I bet many of you know his quotable line is \"Great Scott!\" Lea Thompson plays an innocent Lorraine McFly who falls for Marty and his mother in 1985. Crispin Glover is George McFly who is a teenager in 1955 and Marty's father in 1985. And then Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, many people known him as the best character in franchise. His bully type really does suit the character really well and he throws in one of his catchphrases like \"What are you looking at, butthead?\", \"So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?\" and he hates being covered in manure. Also, I've heard the song \"The Power Of Love\" by Huey Lewis & The News and this is a good song. Christopher Lloyd appears in the music video as Doc Brown from the movie but what really caught me is Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance as one of the teachers. There's also a scene where Marty sings \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry. Yes, this song is in the 50's. In fact, Chuck was thinking about doing this song back in the mid 50's, believe it or not. You know, as much of these sci-fi movies that are popular at the time. Back to the Future is one of those movies you will have to see in the lifetime. It has great directing, fantastic writing, memorable characters, great performances and good effects. It boosted Robert Zemeckis' career up like he directed Romancing the Stone. This is one of my favourite films and my favourite sci-fi film of all time much like what others think of it when they put it in their Top 10 or many number movies. Do not miss this movie. Stay tuned for Back to the Future Part II.\n\"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.\""

Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection.\n...\nFirst and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.\n...\nThe audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!\n...\n(91/100)"

Even those who have never seen the movies know or have heard of them. In the first movie, teenager Marty McFly helps his friend, \"Doc\" Emmett Brown, a half-mad scientist, in his experiments with a time machine built from a DeLorean. But after a few adventures, Marty becomes the first time traveler by accident and gets involved in the midst of her own parents' romance in the 1950s. Now she'll need all the help she can to make sure. back in 1985, that his parents are married and that he himself will exist in the future.\n\nThe film cleverly blends sci fi and comedy. Robert Zemeckis can make things work perfectly by designing a lightweight movie that can entertain and make you laugh, but still smart enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences. The film never tries to be credible or scientifically accurate, nor is it required as it is clearly a comedy. The cast, in turn, is absolutely dominated by the excellent partnership of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, with a series of memorable dialogues in between. Both actors here have probably achieved the most notable roles of their careers. The other actors contribute perfectly.\n\nSpecial effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. The soundtrack has also become iconic. In fact, the entire film has gained classic status, to the point that the film has been preserved as part of American cultural memory. For me personally, it is one of the most remarkable films of the eighties, which has aged very well and still has class, charm and style today."

        "featured-review": {
            "tagline": "the American thriller of the nineties",
            "reviewer": "dbdumonteilDec 12, 2005",
            "review": "One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: \"the movies of the nineties\" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). For others it will be \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) while others will praise to the skies \"Se7en\" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, \"the Usual Suspects\" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches \"the Usual Suspects\" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch \"the Usual Suspects\" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this \"coup de theatre\" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, \"the Usual Suspects\" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening..."

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.\n\n'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.\n\nFilm is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.\n\nIt has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.\n\nOverall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I liked Pete Postlethwaite's asian accent (he plays a character called Kobayashi). It has a bit of a film noir feel to it, in that its gritty, urban and a little bit spooky, with some mildly unsettling music played subtly in the background to remind the viewer that anything could happen at a seconds notice.\n\nIt is dark and bizarre but its definitely a good watch and the pace hots up towards the end. This is a film I'd recommend."

This movie follows on five usual suspects who are arrested for a trumped up charge on hijacked truck with guns. And wouldn't you know it? A mysterious crime lord who is Turkish named Keyser S\u00f6ze which I will not give information about that character. One of my favourite scenes from this movie is when those five criminals get arrested they have to say the tagline they've been given called \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king ****.\" This is the memorable line in the entire film.\n\nTodd Hockney: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king ****.\"\nMichael McManus: \"Give me the f\u00a3$king keys, you f\u00a3$king ****, motherf\u00a3$ker...\"\nFred Fenster: \"Hand me the keys, you ****.\" Hand me the f\u00a3$king keys, you ****. What the f\u00a3$k?\"\nDean Keaton: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king ****.\"\nVerbal Kint: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king ****.\"\n\nThe characters what I get into is the one I love is The Usual Suspects and the only one I got into is Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin. Why is that? Well, he's hilariously cocky and smart mouthed and he says the tagline which I really love and I kinda laughed and chuckled at is my favourite line and that is, \"Give me the f\u00a3$king keys, you f\u00a3$king ****, motherf\u00a3$ker...\" and he does gets a good line. I guess the only factor here is that Kevin Spacey did a great performance as Verbal Kint and yes, he won an Oscar for that and he in the interrogation with Dave Kujan who asks Kint questions about Keyser S\u00f6ze, the dope on the boat and Dean Keaton. I once watched it just to concentrate on Kevin's performance through the entire film. Well, of course everybody remembers the most is the ending. It really adds a twist that who is the real Keyser S\u00f6ze and the fact that everyone believed it, it really is Keyser S\u00f6ze. Okay, now this is an thrill ride experience of The Usual Suspects. Best film of the year hands down. Great writing, great directing, great pacing, great characters, great editing and one great twist ending. This is a fantastic film. I really enjoyed this."

It\u2019s a story of much complexity with a lot of dialogue. This, in combination with the big lack of character depth might seem like a big flaw, but the 3rd act explains a lot of this and it does weigh more than the film\u2019s cons \u2014 for some people. I loved the ending but found most of the 1st and 2nd act slow and uneventful. The third act made the whole flick superbly better, mostly thanks to the film\u2019s mysterious antagonist, the powerful direction by Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey's performance as the character 'Verbal'. It\u2019s one great and dramatic thriller, but that might be a bit too slow for my taste.\n\nPersonal rating: 72/100\nCritical rating: 80/100"

The plot isn't very compelling and very confusing to follow at times, and the twist at the end doesn't pack the punch that it should. The film is partially saved by great actors, but I just wouldn't consider it a very good movie."

If anything, it is this climatic stroke of genius which kills the film. If only the rest of it had been half as good as those last few moments. What comes before that ending is largely forgettable, dull and, by virtue of the ending, obsolete. Of a 108-minute movie, about 8 are worth watching. That is not the signal **** film - rather one overwhelmed by its own ambitions, with a reach that far exceeds its grasp."

With stunning animation, a beautiful soundtrack, and unforgettable characters, this film has earned its place in cinematic history.\n\nThe story follows Simba, a young lion who must come to terms with his destiny as the rightful king of the Pride Lands. Along the way, he learns important lessons about responsibility, friendship, and family. The characters in The Lion King are all memorable, from the wise and benevolent Mufasa to the conniving and power-hungry Scar. Even the comic relief characters, Timon and Pumbaa, provide heartwarming moments that complement the film's more serious themes.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is its soundtrack, composed by the legendary duo of Elton John and Tim Rice. The songs are catchy and uplifting, adding an extra layer of emotional depth to the story. \"Circle of Life\", \"Hakuna Matata\", and \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" are all instant classics that have become synonymous with the film itself.\n\nThe animation in The Lion King is also top-notch, featuring stunning landscapes and lifelike animal movements. The attention to detail is evident in every frame, making the film a joy to watch even after multiple viewings.\n\nOverall, The Lion King is a masterpiece that continues to inspire and entertain audiences of all ages. Its timeless story, beautiful animation, and memorable soundtrack make it a must-watch for any movie lover. A 10/10 rating is well-deserved for this cinematic gem."

It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is \"Can you feel the Love Tonight?\" but the others go without fault, \"Circle of Life\" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10. Bethany Cox"

We were only allowed to watch it till the period was going on, so I never saw it after the 40 minute mark. I could not even watch it anywhere else since we didn't have a TV at home (and even if we did what was the guarantee that this movie would be coming on it?) and internet wasn't as popular as it is today (although there are many reviews here dated before the time). So I finally watched it in 2006, and here's my review.\nYes, I'm fully aware of the fact that even though Walt Disney Animated Pictures claims this is their first original story, this is in fact stolen from the anime Kimba the White Lion. So in protest I will also not take as much effort as the writer of this movie did. But even with that fact in mind this movie is in fact a spectacle for the eye. The voice acting, the animation, the songs, the coherence, the characters - everything is so wonderful. Simba was pretty cute as a child, which is what brought my interest in lion documentaries.\nInstead of remaking the movie in live action, Disney should have just remastered this movie in 4K using AI. It would have been much cheaper and the final product would have also been more well received. They could have removed the 1994 one from their Disney+ library for good which would have made everyone watch the remaster and that would have been a huge profit."

If you ask how heavily lets say if it were in reverse Disney would have unleashed hell and sued them into oblivion. There is even a reference or side-blow by the Simpsons in one episode. To be fair I must also admit that they used some original themes. It is the story of the lion Simba who is the son of the king of lions Mufasa. It is a coming of age or self discovery story transferred in the animal Kingdom. There is a lot more to the story that I cant spoil but will say the story was always entertaining. It has a lot of great additional characters like Timon and Pumbaa who transcended the movie and became the stars of their own show. This is not surprising as they are funny, enjoyable and have a dynamic like only a few duos in Disney movie history. There is of cause Mufasa himself who is a role model for a good and wise king and his brother Scar who is one of the best antagonist in Disney movies. There is also Rafiki who nailed the role of elderly wise man. I will also praise the three hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed as Zazu the majordomos and Nala (cant spoil). The greatest strength are the facial animations that are well transferred to the animals. You can see all (human) emotions and can relate perfectly to the characters. This is a weakness of the remake as more realistic means lifeless or emotionless here. But back to this movie. The overall animations are still looking good today (Aged well). I also praise the soundtrack. They got Elton John and Hans Zimmer (and a lot of other stars). I am the kind of person that does not enjoy singing in Disney movies but this is the exception as it won me over. \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d is great as are \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, \u201cCan you feel the Love tonight\u201d and \u201cI cant wait to be King\u201d. Overall it has a great story with enjoyable characters and you can see the care and thoughtfulness. One of the best Disney movies but a shame that they had to \u201cborrow\u201d so much ideas."

King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and is angered by the birth of the new prince. This is the subject of an argument with first Mufasa's majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, then Mufasa himself.\n\nA few years later, Mufasa shows a young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. Meanwhile, Scar plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (to whom Simba is betrothed) into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard by tricking Zazu. However, the cubs are soon attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa intervenes and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.\n\nScar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. Scar himself does not interfere to save Simba, but instead informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead, sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.\n\nSimba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, who are fellow outcasts and chase away the vultures. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\n\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterward, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall. He also makes Nala his queen.\n\nLater, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life."

Every frame of this movie is wonderful. It has so many stunning moments, it has probably one of the best openings I've ever seen in any movie ever, it has so many emotional moments that are really effective and also some good comedy to balance all the drama. Even when the characters are all animals, their emotions are conveyed through great facial expressions that can make you watch the movie with the sound off and still understand what is going on. The vibrant colors really help to make the settings feel alive. It also tells a rich, compelling and mature story about learning to confront the past and not running away from it. The reason why this movie's story feels so compelling and mature is thanks to wonderful writing. This movie is for kids, sure, but it never feels like  dumb or immature, this is a movie that I appreciate a lot more now as an adult and understand the themes this movie tackles. It's unbelieveable how much effort was put into every single aspect of the visual presentation and the writing. All characters are filled with personality thanks to genius character design. The songs are some of the best in any Disney movie ever. Every single song is memorable and amazing (personally the \"worst\" song of the movie is Hakuna Matata, but even that isn't a bad song) and help the story move forward. The **** my God, the score, it must be one of the best scores I've ever heard in my life and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this movie's score is phenomenal. I honestly want to cry when I hear the score played during the last 10 minutes of the movie.\n\nMy only issues with this movie is probably some writing problems. As much as I praised the writing, there's only one fart joke that honestly felt annoying and almost ruined what was a flawless humor, I said almost because, thank god it was just one of that obnoxious type of humor. Probably Scar's motivation is also a really nitpicking issue, **** did he want to rule the kingdom? Anyway, that's literally the only issues I have and they do not lower the score in any way.\n\nSeriously it's shocking to see how much effort was put into every single aspect of this movie, literally every aspect. This is a flawless movie, sure, it's not the best Disney movie but it's still a masterpiece of animation.\n\nP.S.: No, this is not a Kimba ripoff. The story of Kimba has absolutely nothing to do with The Lion King. Kimba doesn't have characters as compelling as this movie, nor a score as epic, nor an animation as stellar as this movie. A stolen concept or not, I really don't care, because the result in the end, it's just wonderful."

It\u2019s not just the songs that I\u2019m talking about the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is spectacular. The score fits so well with every scene and it helps to intensify the scene. The entire movie is just filled with incredible music. The animation in this film is stunning and, in my opinion, looks better than some of the animated movies we have now a day. The animals have amazing detail on them and you can easily tell that the animators put a lot of effort into making each and every detail. Not just with the animals but the background as well. This is best shown in the \u201cI Just can\u2019t Wait to be King\u201d song where the animators took the time to change up the backgrounds to help convey that this is a dream sequence. I know it\u2019s weird to mention cinematography in an animated film but honestly, this film almost feels like a live-action film and I will do whatever I want because the cinematography is outstanding in this film. From shots where they are showing a bright scene and then quickly changing to dark is just amazing. The characters in this film feel three-dimensional and anybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters. From the people who are free and easy-going like Timon and Pumbaa to the protective parent like Mufasa they all are relatable and had great voice casting. Everybody was perfectly voice casted and I could easily see them as that character. I only really had a problem sometimes with Matthew Broderick where a couple of times I couldn\u2019t really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn\u2019t run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody."

In my opinion, Scar was doing the hyenas and the land a good deed by killing Mufasa, who I deem a fascist."

We wound up shaking our heads afterwards, wondering what made it such a winner. The story is simplistic and violent, and some of the images seem awfully retro in their impact -- for example, all the good guys are a lovely light tawny shade while the villains are dark and, in one scene, the huge glowing eyes and teeth in the dark faces seem designed to make children afraid of African faces for life. The music was very so-so, the voice-acting generally good. There are many other movies I would want to see before trying this one again."

I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things \"your way\" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full."

Launched in 1998, it remains extremely current and relevant today, in the midst of a world where hatred and intolerance seem to have settled in to stay. I'm not just talking about the ****, but about so many others who hate each other for the most diverse and, not infrequently, the most idiotic reasons.\n\nThe film follows the path of two brothers in the **** world: Derek, the eldest, became the leader of the local gang, formed to resist what they considered to be an invasion of their neighborhood by blacks, Latinos and other races. It turns out that he ended up killing, in cold blood, two blacks, and was arrested for it, leaving his younger brother Danny lost and confused. When he gets out of prison, he finds that his brother has followed in his footsteps and is now being indoctrinated to become just like him, even writing an essay laden with **** doctrine for a black teacher at his school... but prison changes people, and Derek no longer follows those ideas. Therefore, he decides to collaborate with the teacher and the authorities, and try to prevent his brother from becoming a person as violent and harmful as he is.\n\nDirected by Tony Kaye, the film was produced under the sign of discord, with constant fights in which the director opposed the revisions and changes demanded by the actors to their material and ideas. Things got to the point where the director wanted to give up, and see the name removed from the credits! Personally, and after seeing the film, I feel the direction is not safe and the film doesn't seem to know where to go at times. The script, in turn, brings us a powerful family drama and addresses tough, pertinent and current issues, such as the breakdown of the family, local neighborhood communities, illegal immigration, hatred between races and religions. The script even manages to avoid portraying **** in a simplistic and one-dimensional way, as fanatical beasts without any humanity, as other films would have done. Even so, it is a simple narrative, sometimes undeveloped, in which some details sound far-fetched. One of the less developed and most important points of the film is the story of Derek in prison: it is inconceivable that such an indoctrinated and fanatical individual could radically change with so little.\n\nThe cast is very good and, without a doubt, one of the strengths of the film. Edward Norton proved to have made the right choice when he decided to star in this film instead of being just another actor in \"Saving Private Ryan\". The film is perfect for him, and the changes that he made to the material he received allowed him to improve the character, smooth the edges and make the fruit of his work even more mature and juicy. The actor is exceptionally good, I've said it on other occasions, and this film shows, once again, his talent. Next to him is Edward Furlong, a young and promising actor who, as we know, never took off. He's good, and he shows us that, even in a movie where the character is relatively minor in the plot. Stacy Keach appears little, but manages to appear menacing and subversive. Beverly D' Angelo is good, but she got a blank character and Avery Brooks limited herself to what she had to do and her character sounds, well, amorphous and uninteresting. Also noteworthy were the honorable appearances of Fairuza Balk (in yet another slightly eccentric character) and Ethan Suplee.\n\nTechnically, it's a film with many points of value in its favor, starting right away with a good filming and cinematography job. The use of black and white to differentiate all flashbacks worked perfectly, even though it sometimes makes the film too dark and seems to me to have been overused. The makeup work, particularly Norton, allows him to assume a younger, aggressive and physically tough face and attitude in the flashback scenes, making a good counterpoint to the portrait of maturity and awareness that the actor brings to us after his character leaves from prison. The sets were really well done, particularly Derek's room with all those **** props. The visual, special and sound effects work well and the soundtrack, signed by Anne Dudley, sounds good, although it is very similar to thousands of other movie soundtracks out there."

                    "review": "This movie was way ahead of its time when it was released, as it discusses topics such as the **** movement and racism in the United States, which is still prevalent today. Tony Kaye does a great job in telling this story and discussing these topics, although it may not have turned out the way he intended to. Edward Norton arguably delivers the best performance in his entire career and it's such a shame that he didn't win an Oscar for it, and Edward Furlong also does a great job in his role. I also love how the film tells its story in a non-linear sequence, as it utilizes the black and white cinematography to showcase the flashbacks and cuts between the past and the present. There are some gruesome violent and sex scenes that I found it a bit hard to watch, but it doesn't take away from the experience. A must see classic that still remains relevant today and will go on to become one of the greatest films ever made."

The reason for this is so, that his brother Danny, doesn't follow the same path on what he did and what it did to him.\n\nThe movie's got some outstandingly good acting from all of the cast especially from Edward Norton, this might be his best performance yet.\n\nThere's lots of dark and racist moments which end up happening throughout this movie and it shows what racism can be really like around the world.\n\nAlso, the moral which this movie's got is honestly well shown and it's about how bad racism really is and how violence begets violence and how it can effect someone.\n\nThe flashback which Derek has in prison shows us what he experienced and how he had great character development when he came out of prison.\n\nOverall, American History X is a great movie. The movie's got a brilliant story, some brilliant acting, some very strong and graphic scenes, a great moral and it shows a lot about racism."

                    "review": "This title, Black and White politics has two dimensions in its context. The first one simply points out the racist drawings about the Black and white people in America and the second one recalls us that the Black & white period were people who seem to be colorless. American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part. In the end, there comes another beginning of the circle where he carries his brother's shot dead body. The politics is just between black and white similarly it was the politics in between right and wrong."

The film is a very interesting story about the trouble of the American society, which is of course very sad and unfortunately but is an important concern. The film's character, Derek, is a very well constructed character, and at least I can sort of understand his opinion and thoughts through the film, and while his opinion changes, mine starts to shift too and I start thinking my self, its a cool happening, with lack of a better word, and caught me off guard.\n\nThe film is very well done and doesn't have many bad scenes, I think the characters and their personality is fantastically done and acted, they were super realistic. This film has some really tough, powerful, violent scenes which I as a teenager liked, but It also had some emotional and sentimental scenes which I also really liked. I feel like both of these elements were very important elements for the film.\n\nAmerican History X got allot of wise life advice and really left you thinking, and that's how you know that it's a good movie."

But Tony Kaye's powerful and challenging direction is what made the movie so provocative.\n\nThe movie also proves that Edward Norton has a huge talent that, unfortunately, has been wasted. Norton delivered the performance of his career in this movie. A performance that elevated the entire movie. While Derek Vinyard, Norton's character, has the most powerful lines in the movie, they wouldn't have been as powerful as they are without Edward Norton's staggering delivering.\n\nAlso, Edward Norton's performance may be the only thing that remained sharp and solid throughout the whole movie. Because aside from Norton's riveting and smart monologues, the dialogue in this movie, especially at the first two acts, is so weak and often cheesy! The things got better at the last act but at that time I was wondering why the dialogue wasn't that good most of the movie. It's really baffling because the movie needed badly to have a decent and strong dialogue from its beginning, considering its subject matter. The dialogue often was too on the nose and preachy while it should have served its already gripping story. That also made some scenes in the movie feel so awkward and heavy-handed.\n\nThe dialogue isn't the only, or the biggest issue I've with American History X. As I think that everything related to the Neo **** gang is completely underdeveloped. All the characters of the members of this gang are one-dimensional characters. They are totally undeveloped and bland, and almost have no depth. Which is a shame because they play a pivotal part in the story. They are part of the main plot, so to speak.\n\nBesides that balancing between two contradictory aspects of the story, Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colorful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is. Smoothly moving camera in the scenes in Black and White that are set in the past to convey an unsettling feeling, and bleak and restrained colored scenes to match the dystopian-like present.\n\nAmerican History X also has one of the most shocking endings ever. But its ambiguity is what makes it more dreadful. It's an ending that can make you question the protagonist's fate, and that's more than horrifying!\n\n(8/10)"

This film is considered controversial because of its content and its language but I feel that it is one of the most important films ever. Edward Norton may have but his best performance ever in this film and Edward Furlong manages to shine yet again at such a young age. I love every aspect in which the story is told, which is in a very unorthodox timeline but is very appropriate for the movie and the film splits between colour and black and white."

Finally, a film that can convey a willingness to open oneself to new ideas, without writing off certain beliefs as taboo or evil. I can't say it doesn't take any side, but it certainly doesn't force any side on the viewer, and instead forces us to assert the situation as a whole. It's just an excellently directed and acted film in every way, and I think everyone should get the chance to witness what it has to offer."

Edward Norton gives an absolute masterclass and the two performances he gives either side of his characters transition are both incredibly captivating. There's no doubting how manipulative and pretentious this film can be. And at times the propaganda can even feel persuasively targeted at the audience. But to the films credit that's what makes it so compelling. And ultimately you cannot believe such evil, destructive & irrational people like this actually exist. Tony Kaye's overall direction is impressive and the black and white sequences in particular look stunning. American History X is certainly a tough film to enjoy but personally I think it's essential viewing and an incredibly bold piece of filmmaking."

Edward Norton is absolutely phenomenal. He takes this deeply troubled character who comes to realize what is truly going on his life and he knocks it out of the park. He was terrific and put the film on his shoulders and absolutely killed it. The director, Tony Kaye, while he wishes to distance himself from the final product, he did a great job as well. There was some beautiful imagery here and while it may not be the version he intended as the final cut, his vision absolutely is here and the messages it provokes is still powerful. Really, after watching this film, I felt like I had been hit by a ton of bricks. The entire film is so moving and affecting that it really leaves you in a trance once it ends and the credits start rolling. On top of that, there are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as the final one. It really leaves you on the brink of tears as you try to deal with what you just watched.\r\n\r\nA truly mesmerizing character study with a heart and soul, American History X should absolutely be considered a \"must watch\" for all."

But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Herv\u00e9 de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."

Suspenseful, I'd say slightly moving and simply gripping. In my eyes, this is an amazing film. I think it's a great choice for war movie fans, but don't expect an action movie. It might even catch the attention of people who aren't into war movies that much. It's not about the action. In short, a good quality biopic. I thought it was great."

This is one of them... not because it is a film about the Jewish holocaust, because there are a lot of films about that, but because of the raw way in which it approached it, without artifice or heroism. Directed with absolute mastery by Roman Polanski - himself a Holocaust survivor, with many harsh memories of the time, some of them used here - the film seeks to mirror the personal account of the difficulties experienced by Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist who worked on the radio when the Poland is invaded by **** Germany.\n\nI have not read the original account written by Szpilman, who would die at a time when the film was being made, but I give credit to Polanski's efforts. The director wanted a faithful, realistic and sincere account, and managed to turn his film into a historically faithful and credible portrayal of the facts and events that took place in Warsaw during the German invasion, including the occupation of the city, the forced relocation of Jews to the ghetto and transport to the extermination camps, the harsh living conditions experienced by those who lived in the ghetto and the way in which the Polish resistance and confined Jews collaborated to oppose the invaders, in a work that reached its peak with the Ghetto Revolt, suppressed with extreme violence, as we know. The pianist's story unfolds among all these facts, making Szpilman the eyewitness of all this. In the midst of absolute barbarism, dissonant notes that help us not to see reality in black and white: a Jewish police that collaborates with the **** by oppressing their ethnic brothers, a Polish housewife who does not hesitate to denounce that Jew that hides in the apartment next door, and a German officer who, against all odds, is willing to help him, even giving him his military coat, so he won't get cold. War and life have these things.\n\nAdrien Brody, still young, achieved with this film the most striking and powerful interpretation of his career to date. He's a great actor, he'll have a lot of opportunities to do something as good or better, but I have to admit that it's going to be difficult to give us something so powerful and intense. Next to him, we have good performances by Frank Finlay, Emilia Fox, Michal Zebrowski and Thomas Kretschmann, among other actors, all of them two or three steps below Brody.\n\nTechnically, the film makes the most of the chosen filming locations in Warsaw, where filming was concentrated. The sets and costumes are loaded with detail and realism, transporting us to the time and historical context with a truly enviable rigor, worthy of a documentary. To this work, we have to associate impeccable and beautifully thought out cinematography, where light and color gradually disappear, as all the action progresses and the atrocities become more and more evident. There are also some very well executed CGI effects that take us through a city devastated by bombing and fighting. The tension and harshness of the events keep us stuck with the film until the end, and the brutality and destruction of the war are the icing on the cake. The soundtrack brings together a series of magnificent melodies by Chopin, a composer who knew how to explore the harmony and nostalgia of the piano as almost no one else knew how to do after him. Ironically or not, this Polish composer was anti-Semitic (like many people in his time), which did not prevent pianists of Jewish blood like Arthur Rubinstein from poring over his scores to the great delight of music lovers..."

I suppose the piano playing, if only depicted on ocassion, presents the viewer with a clear sense of the beauty that still existed by those who were otherwise forced to be labelled as among the lowest class of people in German history at that time. There's undeniably a strong poignancy there. It conveys a depiction of disintegration, on a both personal and societal level.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments is depicted right at the start of the film, when said pianist (Wladyslaw Szpilman) is performing in I assume a recording studio and the impact of war based action is impossible to ignore.\n\nThis is a chilling/sobering watch. It highlights the hypocricy of the time its set and Adrien Brody gives a particularly powerful performance I'd say. A very thought provoking and sobering film, I'd recommend this."

This film is set in Poland during the second World War when Jews were being persecuted in the Holocaust, although many know of its horrors this movie really displays to what extent the Jews would be targeted and tortured and highlights how the suffering was universal, instead of selected the Jews who had done something wrong they are all bunched together and treated as less than human, The Pianist really does well to display this through the mood of the areas in which the movie takes place and through character development shows the corruption of the body both physically and mentally, lacking in trust and doing all it takes to survive. Despite its name, The Pianist has very little piano scores throughout the whole film played by the protagonist which makes the ones he does play even more impactful and beautiful, a man stripped of what he treasures, finally gets to enjoy it again. This movie is a real tear-jerker especially as it's based on a true story if you are interested in war this movie will shine a true and honest light on it and if you enjoy classical music in anyway this movie is definitely for you, it will bring an new and powerful connection between you and your music."

                    "review": "Roman Polanski's new movie, \"The Pianist,\" is based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a star of Polish radio and cafe society in the 1930's and a member of Warsaw's assimilated Jewish middle class, who lived through the **** occupation and the Warsaw ghetto. Szpilman's recollections, published shortly after the war, offer, like other such books, a deeply paradoxical impression of the Holocaust. Accounts of survival, that is, are both representative and anomalous; they at once record this all but unimaginable historical catastrophe and, without intentional mendacity or inaccuracy, distort it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this could not be simpler. Most of the intended victims of **** genocide did not survive; the typical Jewish experience in 1940's Europe was death. One of the main genres that allow later generations access to this time thus presents an inevitably unrepresentative picture of it.\r\n\r\nWe naturally identify with the protagonists of these books, and the characters based on them in movies and plays, and so imagine that we would have been among the lucky ones, even if the real odds suggest otherwise. (We also comfort ourselves in the vain belief that, had we been there, we would have bravely defied the ****, risking our own well-being to help their victims.) When it is not treated with the uneasy sentimentality reserved for miracles, survival \u2014 whether through dumb luck, resilience, the kindness of strangers or some combination of these \u2014 is often viewed with a deep and bitter sense of the absurd.\r\n\r\nMr. Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion. When death is at once so systematically and so capriciously dispensed, survival becomes a kind of joke. By the end of the film, Szpilman, brilliantly played by Adrien Brody, comes to resemble one of Samuel Beckett's gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of his own experiences, Mr. Polanski approaches this material with a calm, fierce authority. This is certainly the best work Mr. Polanski has done in many years (which, unfortunately, is not saying a lot), and it is also one of the very few nondocumentary movies about Jewish life and death under the **** that can be called definitive (which is saying a lot). And \u2014 again paradoxically \u2014 this is achieved by realizing the modest, deliberate intention to tell a single person's story, to recreate a specific and finite set of events. (Ronald Harwood's script does take some necessary liberties with Szpilman's account, but these seem justified by the demands of movie storytelling.)\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Polanski's trademarks is what might be called (to continue multiplying paradoxes) a humane sadism. He has always been fascinated by what happens to weak, ordinary people \u2014 Mia Farrow in \"Rosemary's Baby,\" for instance, or Jack Nicholson in \"Chinatown\" \u2014 when they are intruded upon by evil forces more powerful than they, and he punishes his actors, peeling back their vanity to make them show the face of humanity under duress.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Brody's most appealing features \u2014 from \"King of the Hill\" 10 years ago through such varied and underseen pictures as \"Restaurant,\" \"Summer of Sam\" and \"Bread and Roses\" more recently \u2014 is his quick-witted, almost smart-alecky ****. His Szpilman, in the first section of \"The Pianist,\" has the gait of a self-satisfied dandy and the smug smile of a man who takes charm and good fortune as his birthright. As he plays piano in a broadcast studio, an explosion rattles the building. He ducks, wipes some plaster off his sleeve, and keeps playing. Later Szpilman refuses to allow the widespread panic at the German invasion to interfere with more pressing matters, like the seduction of a star-struck young woman named Dorota (Emilia Fox).\r\n\r\nMr. Polanski, working in Poland for the first time in 40 years (and also in Prague), reconstructs the look and rhythm of life in the ghetto with care and sobriety. You feel the dread and confusion of the inhabitants, and you also observe their intuitive, futile attempts to master the situation \u2014 circulating underground newspapers, smuggling contraband through the walls and quietly arming themselves for resistance."

The promotional hype for the film ensured you did not have a clue what it was about and people who had seen the movie were asked not to reveal the ending. You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled. The characters were great, the direction perfect and the music, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, made this a classic.I still get scared when I see it on TV."

The case for Hitchcock as a modern Conrad rests on this ruthless investigation of the heart of darkness, but the film is uniquely Hitchcockian in its positioning of the godlike mother figure. It's a deeply serious and deeply disturbing work, but Hitchcock, with his characteristic perversity, insisted on telling interviewers that it was a \"fun\" picture."

Alfred Hitchcock's marketing was excellent, contributing to those who saw it only to be able to watch it from beginning to end. This presentation allowed for the movie to be seen in its entirety and for those watching it to avoid distraction and not miss a single aspect of the film. If you even look down at your phone and miss part of the movie, you may become confused and even miss essential details Hitchcock didn't want the audience to miss. The best part of the film is that the ending is unpredictable. And the conclusion is quite shocking. This presentation contributed to the audience's enjoyment of the film.             Hitchcock also does an excellent job of establishing the bond between each character and giving the audience insight into their relationship. The audience witnesses this when Marion Crane and Norman Bates have lunch in the parlor. During the same scene, Hitchcock is able to use birds to represent each character's motivations, from the birds hanging in the parlor to Marion's last name being Crane and her being from Phoenix.       Something I wish Hitchcock had done differently is set up what happened to Norman to cause him to commit the actions he does. I wish Hitchcock had given us a better understanding of Norman's mother and their conflict to heighten the terror on the screen.       I encourage you to watch Psycho if you enjoy older horror movies, but be aware you might be left with many questions, but you have the ability to make your own assumptions about what happens, just as I have. And don't forget to keep an eye out for the birds hanging on the wall."

I can imagine how shocking the really very tame yet attempted to be borderline horror scenes appeared to the cinema audiences when it was released. Undoubtedly the musical score adds a lot to the tension and perceived atmosphere of this film - it still seems very effective for that purpose. I wasn't aware of the entire story, apart from the main scene (the shower scene) and one or two other basic plot details, so I thought it was interesting to watch it and learn more about the full context of the plot. On watching, I was surprised that the key scene happened so early on but I did feel it did well at keeping the viewer feeling a bit edgy and tense and keen/curious to learn what might be discovered about the mysterious Mr. Bates and his mother. There are certainly some plot twists present and while I wouldn't say its by any means constantly an edge of your seat watch, I appreciated that there was more of an investigative, crime/mystery side to it. I think this is a good example of a psychological thriller of its time and certainly if your keen on Hitchcock films then this is an obvious must see. By todays standards, its very tame but as an example of a film that slowly compels the viewer to want to know more and that has a chilly atmosphere, this is most definitely a good one. Yes, I would recommend this film."

Also, Janet Leigh has such expressive eyes, which explains why the camera is always focus on her face. At one point while watching the movie, I was reaching for my drink until a certain scene caught me off guard and froze me in place. That scene is where Marion Crane is waiting at the traffic light and sees her boss crossing the street, both locking eyes. It is more effective if you watch it yourself.\n\nWhy do I have a feeling Alfred Hitchcock was a serial killer in a past life."

Each and every scene of this movie is perfect. Not even a single scene was unnecessary.\n\nThe acting by all the actors especially the role of Bates was perfectly done. The plot was different and had a lot of surprises at the end. The climax was really unpredictable. Movie had a lot of iconic scenes like shower scene and Bate smiling climax. The direction could not be better. Full marks for direction. Even after being a black and white movie, it is none less than coloured one.\n\nOverall, I will recommend this to everyone. A must watch."

My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.\n\nPsycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.\n\nOther pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox"

When he is peeping on Janet he gets shamed and becomes her, his mother is his shame.  Janet also was absolutely amazing, her being Jamie Curtis' mom makes it 2 generations of scream queen headlining. The only difference is by the 70s it had become ok for the girl to be the dominant factor.  my favorite shot in the movie is the first time he sits there sipping tea like an old lady, getting worked up to kill.  Also, the mom is a liar, she pinned it all on  Norman, he got a raw deal."

            "review": "There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Caf\u00e9 American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made."

The story moves at a brisk pace, has twist & turns (but you can generally readily follow it), is perhaps the best lit movie in history, and the sets somehow clearly are on a movie lot but also give you a sense of place.\nThe script has a dozen-plus memorable lines, and Ingrid Bergman is not only gorgeous but an excellent actor. Lots of people do good-to-great-work, but special kudos to Claude Raines who sinks his teeth into a complex role and gives it the exact right edge of fun, danger, cynicism, and heart--he's the star among stars. Bogart is very good, but a bit overwrought in a couple places (perhaps this is because he wasn't used to playing the romantic lead?).\n\nEvery film fan should see this at least once."

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the caf\u00e9 was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as \"seems as though Destiny is at hand\". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the \"cynical sentimentalist\" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Right from the beginning it throws so much at you that it is hard to keep up, and the story goes in so many unexpected directions.  There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the ****, won me over.  This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in \u201cCasablanca\u201d feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost. Anyone with a tolerance of full framed black and white should be able to take something enjoyable away from this movie.  I give it an A - Make a point to go see this movie."

And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt.\n\nThe Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be **** with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies.\n\nTo me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only."

            "review": "\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira,\" or \"Princess Mononoke,\" or \"Spirited Away\" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is \"Grave of the Fireflies.\"What we have with \"Grave of the Fireflies,\" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the \"Schindler's List\" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone."

Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and \"depressing\" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Yes war certainly is violent and extreme but 'The Grave of the Fireflies' manages to show us how insidious its damages can be on people and especially children and teenagers. How hard it is to be uprooted when the only thing you need is love, security and wamrth.\n\nWith such a original score, an environment such as Japan and a level of animation not far from excellence Toho Company had everything to produce a touching and moving movie. It is easy to have empathy for almost all the characters if you manage to get into the constant war atmosphere."

The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.\n\nThe characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.\n\nAll in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Too bad that we don't get Westerns like these today. .\n.\nGood : I can say \"entire film\" and get away with it, but I won't. The character introductions in this film are some of the best character introductions of all times. Especially those of \"Harmonica\" and Frank. The intros don't have a dialogue or an exposition to introduce them. All the movie does is show you the characters, clearly indicating that they're up to something. One of those characters was played by Charles Bronson and the other by the great Henry Fonda. And, I don't know if this was the first time Fonda played such a character, but I was blown away by seeing him in a role like that. I didn't expect him to be a bad guy when I first saw him. Fonda being cast against type in this movie is perhaps the most mind blowing example of casting against type. And Fonda doesn't even remind me of his \"messiah\" characters at all. The characters are very interesting in their own right - every main character - Jill, Frank, Harmonica and Cheyenne. Harmonica has that mysterious origin similar to Eastwood's character in Dollars films. It's just an exception that Harmonica was not so mysterious but is still a Man with no Name. He resembles a lot to Eastwood's iconic character, but is quite a lot different at the same time. Cheyenne is a sort of a comedic anti hero, who will do some badass things and will also make you laugh. Jill - probably the most complex character of them all. It feels as if she is too selfish and has mood swings quite often, but having watched it many times, it's clearly justifiable by her apparent past. It wasn't selfishness, but sorrow. I won't say her characterization is relatable or so, but it is realistically understandable. Frank sounds like a generic bad guy, but he has a menacing presence. He is calm and focused. That mixed with the amazing performance of Fonda makes him a good villain. Even secondary characters like Morton are memorable. You can feel for him, though he is a c**t. He is a very good supporting character. The story doesn't have much complexity to it. But that doesn't hold the movie down. Leone has shown his ability of visual storytelling once again. There is mystery and there is unfolding of the story. But most of it is told via the scenes, not with exposition. Leone knows how to build suspense. He shows something, he creates the subtlety and then he explodes everything. This works incredibly well in all of his films. That, along with Morricone's epic music takes it to a whole new level of greatness. There is nothing in this movie to be deemed as stupid. Everything, including character dynamics and story unfolding, is incredibly interesting. You won't even feel the time passing due to the great visual storytelling by Sergio Leone. Every actor - Fonda, Bronson, Robard and Cardinale give their best. .\n.\nConclusion : It is one of the greatest films in the genre. It is not your old and typical \"wupikaayaayokaaiyayyy\" kind of Western, but retains the many things of those purely American and goofy Westerns like happy ending and triumph of good over bad and all that. But isn't goofy or slimy. It is intense and can be taken seriously. If you are a fan of Western films, or not, this is a must watch. .\n.\nRating. .\n.\nScore : absolute 10/10\nGrade : golden A+"

But what I didn't expect to see is one of the best, and most profound, contemplative movies ever made!\n\nSignifying the end of the Old West, Sergio Leone loaded his near-three-hour sprawling epic with symbols. The symbolism is seen in almost every aspect of the movie; the setting, the costumes, the music, and most importantly, the characters. In fact, each character stand for an iconographic Western role. But Leone did humanize them through his melodrama, and the result is that all the characters became some of the most interesting and compelling characters ever!\n\nWhat amazed me is how rich the plot seems despite its simplicity. And as convoluted as the narrative sounds, the movie never lost me. That's simply because the story is actually pretty simple, but the sophisticated themes and symbolic characters gave it mythic feeling.\n\nAside from its remarkable opening scene, which became one of my all-time favorites, I found the first hour of unbearably tedious! I usually don't mind watching movies with a deliberate pace, but almost the entire first hour gave us nothing but glances of each of the interesting characters that I totally invested in afterwards. The extremely strong, compelling, sympathetic, interesting and memorable characters portrayed by a spectacular charismatic cast definitely made me forget how bored I was during the first act, but also definitely didn't make me forget that I was about to fall asleep a couple of times!\n\n(8.5/10)"

                    "review": "I have seen the light. Years ago, I saw two of them Man With the No Name trilogy entries by Sergio Leone and I liked them a lot. But, I did not love them. Once Upon a Time in the West was even going the same way for me until halfway through. Until then, it was a good western, but one with far too many sequences of somebody just staring off into the distance and then looking back, only to look off into the desert again. By the halfway point though, something changed. It clicked. This staring became brilliant. The scenes of action well earned and brilliantly executed. It is a pitch perfect western and was the very embodiment of what the genre is and was capable of becoming. With a terrific score, great acting, and brilliant direction, Once Upon a Time in the West is a tremendous film.\n\nA story concocted by Leone, Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci, will hardly ever turn out poorly and Once Upon a Time in the West shows why. Its story - a man and his family with a land settlement are killed by a ruthless man. His widow is left with the land, which is apparently quite valuable as the railroad is set to come through the acreage and her husband planned on building a town surrounding it, having already purchased the materials. It is the perfect settlement and the criminals of the wild west know the score. In its relatively simplistic plotting, the film is clearly influential on a variety of westerns, such as Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller or Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider. Both revisionist westerns, the films show upstart towns with unexpected value. Altman's film shows a frontierman who marries a prostitute (just like in this film), who meets his demise after his town becomes the target of men who wish to control the whole area. Pale Rider has a similar set-up, but with gold under the settlement. A variety of westerns have had this set-up, but both of those feel cut from the same contemplative and methodically paced cloth as Leone's film.\n\nDirection-wise, the film is pitch perfect. Terrific staging of each sequence, a largely tight plot, and beautiful imagery adorn this film. For a film so slow and long, it never bores. There is significant power in the random close-ups of the film and it is because of the direction of Leone. The film is engaging due to the varied approach to the gun battles and characterizations in the film, with each sequence having characters hiding in signs or shadows, creating a great sense of mystery and originality each time a man brandishes a gun. Additionally, each character wears their personality on their sleeve. Every drop of this film is precise and included for a reason, even if the film is not dealing with overly complex themes or anything. It is simply a tight, straight forward western that hums along at its own pace. One of the strongest parts of this film, however, is the score from Ennio Morricone. At a certain point, the men all look the same. They are tanned white guys with beards. It is hard to tell them apart. Morricone's score helps. It serves as an introduction to who they are, what to expect from the scene, and it cultivates atmosphere. Numerous scenes ride on the sense of mystery instilled by Morricone's score that keeps the viewer alert to the fact that something is off or that something is about to happen. The score not only serves for dramatic impact and as an extension of the characterization, but it is also quite sonically pleasing with Morricone's classic western chords coming to play throughout the film and really creating the perfect ambiance for this film. There is not a note that goes wrong with every chord and line coming off beautifully and helping to created a full figured beauty of a film.\n\nA classic and masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that I should have seen long ago, but I am glad to have encountered it now because I was finally ready to let Leone into my life as the master that he was. Brilliantly scored, directed, and paced, the film may be long, but its preciseness and terrific technical and visual elements sink their hooks into you with ease and never let go until the film ends. Of the 1960s westerns from Leone, this one certainly ranks as the strongest and with great reason. This is a film that soars on its unpredictability and originality, constantly keeping the audience guessing as to how everything will turn out due to both the plotting and staging of the film and its shootouts. This is not just some simple shoot 'em up western. This is a film with violence and shootouts that advance the plot and serve a purpose, which give them significant stakes and power. Once Upon a Time in the West is just so damn good."

Mustering three Hollywood toughies Bronson, Fonda and Robards, the film evidently echoes the pattern of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966, 8/10), although Bronson is a perfect specimen embodies both the Ugly and the Good, and for the first time Sergio deploys a woman, the Mediterranean beauty Cardinale to be a pivot among these three, contrives an interwoven plot with vengeance, duel, murder, vice as well as the righteous side of the Western ideology: masculinity, integrity, fraternity and chivalry.\r\ncontinue reading my review on my blog: google cinema omnivore, thanks"

                    "review": "An epic about the expansion and construction as the frontier pushed toward the pacific, interlined with one man's journey to make someone pay for what he did in the past.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Leone makes it clear that his focus on portraying the life and environment of the West would supersede any need to tell the story. His self appointed task of showing all the mundane happenings and goings on of this world is well achieved. A train station is shown where the typical protagonist of a Western, who never has a name, engages himself in a shoot-out while in search for a man named Frank.\r\n\r\nFocus shifts to McBain and his family who owns a land in the middle of nowhere. He is clearly suspicious about something that is going to happen and we are rewarded with what it is almost immediately. During this conflict we are introduced to this Frank that the first man was searching for.\r\n\r\nA woman enters the story right around here who becomes more involved in the plot as the movie progresses, so is another character by the name of Cheyenne. She suddenly finds herself the centre of attention among outlaws and rail-road companies. The treatment of women is summed up quite clearly the way men behave with her. She is initially a woman who is well dressed and of a noble birth by all accounts and if even that could not gain her even the lowest level of respect, nothing could. The latter is the more engaging of any characters in the script, and thank God for his presence.\r\n\r\nAs the plot thickens, the mysterious man looks for Frank, Cheyenne seeks to clear his name in an incident involving multiple killings, and Frank helps his partner acquire land in the path of the envisioned rail-road to the pacific. The first two decide to stick around and help Jill with something that would honour the memory of the man who was killed, while Frank does all he can to take the land he needs to build the rail-road.\r\n\r\nFrank asks the man twice who he is, to which he lists the names of some of the men he has killed. It is not enough that Frank should die. He needs to suffer while thinking about why this man wants to kill him. To this purpose he is even saved by this man. And surely enough, when Frank cannot take it any more, he himself goes after the man to find out the reason. At this point we finally learn the secret.\r\n\r\nI felt like the movie lost steam an hour and a half into it and after that it felt like a task just to finish watching it. It was a narrative mess. The Man has every intention to come across as mysterious and awe-inspiring, but I found it frustrating after a while. He seemed to be content with wasting other people's (including the audience) time. I found Cheyenne much more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue was sparse. Only Cheyenne knew how to say things that would make people laugh and keep humoured, which was essential given the length of the movie. The plot develops linearly but Leone decided that it wasn't doing it for him and jumbled up everything. Some plot jumps took place, one of which infuriated me the most. The cinematography captured the bleak landscape of the West. The score was slow paced and introduced tension during the key moments. The set design depicted the life at the frontier with the wooden towns, horse-drawn carriages, sweaty people, all that.\r\n\r\nConsidered the greatest of Leone's work, I could not agree in good conscience. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was a hell of a lot more fun and had engaging characters, even though it had a fraction of the budget for this movie, proving once again that great movies need not be created through extravagance.  Here, the characters seemed bland for the most part. They seemed not to know where they had to move in service to the story and wandered around aimlessly. There was not a single scene that cut it out for me. The only thing that Once did better was portray the daily life and toil of ordinary people in the west.\r\n\r\nThe movie failed to make a major impact on my emotions and senses right until the last shoot-out, which speaks for Leone's idea of greatness_ bore people so much that they have to see the timer several times to make sure the movie is headed forward. While it can be argued that the movie depicted the general life in the west quite effectively, I for one feel that story always trumps the need for grand style and an urge to make some kind of a statement. There's no doubt that the setting needs to be strong, but the characters need to be much stronger, which in turn should give way to the plot."

He'll at least make the top ten. At least Wood could make a story interesting, at least one character you might care about, and didn't have the gigantic Leone budget. Leone fails on every level. The story is very disjointed. It's mostly just comically unrealistic gunplay, with some guys being able to kill minor characters from great distances, but unable to kill major stars that should be easier. That's nothing new, but the circumstances are quite laughable. The story is just killing after killing, to take land away, and it follows sadist Henry Fonda, and his opponents, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Jack Elam appears in what amounts to a cameo. The characters aren't much to like. Bronson makes little jokes like an underdog hero of a Japanese movie, but the plot is so bad, and the characters so unlikable, you don't really care. To be fair, they aren't as unlikable as other spaghetti Westerns, but they don't have any appeal, either. You struggle to watch the film. You won't be able to do in one sitting. You'll have to watch a piece at a time, because you will fall to sleep. What makes the movie a bomb is the use of such outstanding cool music that neither matches or contrasts the situation. It falls flat, and it is a waste of good music."

Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories.

Static settings demand for things such as cinematography, writing and performances to have to be at their best as they are the story, what keeps attention.  Hitchcock is stunning at creating sublime story's that simmer and build into thrilling crescendos and rear window is his best example of that with his idiosyncratic camerawork swoops like the voyeur the main character is. Grace Kelly is an engrossing independent brave socialite reporter and Stewart a cynical photographer but Ritter stands out as the sharp wit nurse. The script is exceptionally well written . Not the best film I've seen but it's right there."

It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as \"the villain of the piece,\" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

Its interesting how Jeff (the main character) interprets the observations he witnesses. Its all a case of context, I suppose. Hearing him query other peoples interpretations of what he saw made me doubt the truth behind the circumstances. Its definitely a strong case of armchair detective, of course (how could it not?). It features a strong performance from both James Stewart and Grace Kelly, who is quick to challenge his assumptions. It makes me wonder what do others read in to otherwise seemingly every day activities and observations?. Its a slow builder, plot wise but it does well at pulling the audience in, questioning things.\n\nIts an intriguing watch, I found surprisingly tense, so I'd recommend it."

Kelly and Stewart are phenomenal (Kelly especially), but the other characters all LOOK like they are acting.\nMisc.: 10/10...Hitchcock is just masterful with the camerawork, editing, score, lighting. All the subtle stuff you aren't supposed to notice isn't noticeable, which is what makes it noteworthy! Phenomenal directing.\nOverall: 9/10...a few parts age quite poorly, but it's clearly a masterpiece and the inspiration for so many single-set movies that followed in it's wake."

Like many of the films of this director, it could almost be staged as a play, given that almost all the action takes place in the same place: the apartment of the protagonist. The script is excellent, although moments of too much predictability. The performance of the main actors is impeccable and striking, and I consider this one of the best films of Kelly's career. The photograph also deserves a very positive note. The rest (soundtrack, costumes, scenery etc.) is reasonable without surprise or particular attention.\n\nI always heard people talk of this movie when it came in Hitchcock's name. But to see the film, I was of the opinion that this director did some more interesting and remarkable films. Either way, it's a good movie, it is worth to be seen and appreciated, and that will please a lot to most suspense fans or thrillers."

To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.\n\nI have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.\n\nCinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.\n\nThe characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

That being said, The earliest parts of the movie are the most magical, and you won't appreciate the first act unless you watch the reach the end of the movie.\n\nThe second and the third act are less magical, and not very original, but they are narratively stronger than the first, and have wonderful messages presented by fantastic performances from Marco Leonardi, as Teenager Tot\u00f2, and Jacques Perrin, as Adult Tot\u00f2. Also, Philippe Noiret's performance as Alfredo is one of the most poignant, and iconic performances in film! Ennio Morricone's score will hit you right in the feels, it's his best, IMO.\n\nYou'll get nostalgic feeling only from the movie. Simply, because Cinema Paradiso isn't like any movie I've ever seen, because it's like life!\n\n(8.5/10)"

I really liked the way the story was told with hints towards the future and the multiple stages of Salvatore's life. The production design is also great, as is the score. My one complaint is the lack of depth to Salvatore's love **** named Elena. Symbolically, it makes sense, but I'd still like to see more, but regardless, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film.

The film starts with successful filmmaker, Salvatore Di Vita, receiving the news that his former hometown's old biograph-projectionist has passed away. After receiving the news, he takes a nostagic look back at his youth. Remebering his childhood in Sicilly, his early fascination with cinema, his bond with the projectionist Alfredo and his first love with a young woman named Elena.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of difficult to decide what I should start praising this film for. The film is simply perfect and I can't wait to see the original directors cut which adds about an hour. The soundtrack contains some of Ennio Morricone's best work and the filming locations paint an even more beautiful picture of Sicilly than The Godfather films. Non-linear storytelling is quite common, but I can't think of any film that have utilized it in quite this fashion and jumps back and forth between different points of a man's life in this manner. We get to follow the character Salvatore in three different points of his life, as a child, as an adolescent and as an adult. Salvatore as a child is brought to life by Salvatore Cassio, I recently stated that I consider Judith Vittet's performance in City of Lost Children to be the best child actor's performance I've seen, but after watching Cinema Paradiso I'm torn between Cassio and Vittet. The adolescent Salvatore is played by Marco Leonardi and the adult Salvatore is played by Jacques Perrin. These three actors bring an incredible consistency to the character with some very fine acting and also brings the same consistency to the dynamic between them and the astonishingly gifted veteran actor, Philippe Noiret, who plays Alfredo the charismatic projectionist of Cinema Paradiso and Salvatore's only father figure.\r\n\r\nHow director Guiseppe Tornatore is able to create the feeling of nostalgia when portraying a time I wasn't a part of and a place I never visited escapes me, but a big factor might be that he uses every movie-lover's nostalgia towards cinema and fascination with movies to create this heartfelt Italian masterpiece. Cinema Paradiso is an unforgettable feat which incorporates a broad variety of the emotions a person might go through in their life into the story and from Salvatore's perspective the viewer gets to experience joy, friendship, passion and love, but also sorrow, loneliness, longing and heartbreak. Undoubtedly this is one of the grandest and most sentimental coming of age films ever created."

            "review": "Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia.  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project.  While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable.  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.Since film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  I don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance.  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful.  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  Maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer."

And there are several reasons why this is so for me.\n\nI love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.\n\nOverall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

'City Lights' is unlike any other films that have come after it because it truly is rooted in delivering a story that is fueled on basic human wants and emotions. The only thing I wish was better was its pacing, and no, I don't mean that because it is a silent film that needs to use cards for dialogue, it's just that some of its scenes drag. However, all is more than forgiven because this film contains quite possibly the best concluding payoff ever put onto film. I truly mean that, the ending to this film perfectly captures raw expressions that are enough to move all who have watched this adorably funny, yet poignant, adventure. Bravo!"

Now that I have revisited them I found a newfound appreciation for this era (somewhat). From The Kid to The Gold Rush, all his movies have laughs and heart, something I never thought I'd find in comedies. City Lights takes the cake for me sharing a slice of it with Modern Times.\n\nThe Tramp in some scenes might come off as a booze-drinking, cigar-chomping klutz but this is only because of his selflessness that leads him into these circumstances putting him in one comedic situation to another. What I love about this movie is the relationship he develops with a blind flower girl which blossoms (pun intended) into something pure and innocent. This contrasts his relationship with the millionaire who takes him galavanting, often leading into trouble. Don't let the lack of color and spoken dialogue fool you, this movie packs a lot of heartfelt moments, further cementing Charlie Chaplin's place in cinema history. Must watch."

                    "review": "Real Rating: 83.5/100\nThis is my 3rd favourite film of Chaplin's. Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?\nBE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.\n\nW: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.\n\nC: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.\n\nA: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.\u00a0\n\nS: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare.\n\nPD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.\n\nBA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself.\n\nEVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal. Rather than your standard romantic movie which is like eating a 15 kg bag of marshmallows in a single sitting."

This is how the film travels making sure that both of them are present at once.\n\nCity Lights\n\nCharlie Chaplin's boxing match is not a serious match. I know that's obvious. But it is not. Not expected. At the back your thoughts, you are always waiting to get things serious. Gritty. Bloody. Brutal. Intense. And it is these films that makes us expect these things from a genre as such. Not even touching the Rocky milestone, I am just playing around Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese and Battling Butler by Michel Keaton- someone from Charlie's days itself. They've all tried to plaster the sincerity of that job on screen. You can joke around, fool around as much as you like but that sport is respected with a jarring punch when the time comes.\n\nNot to say that Charlie doesn't respect it. His method of living up to that \"dutiful\" objective is somewhat different. Nay, not different. Mature. Ahead of time. He doesn't pay homage to those heavy lifters by putting them in the ring, but does it so elegantly in the dressing room. From hard work to the stakes that are played every night on the screen, everything is mocked or more accurately notified in Charlie's dictionary. There is a sense of pride in carrying that note.\n\nAnd maybe that is why he has crafted such an empathetic and a low key character in the rest of the screen time. He is wreck but an adoptable one. Another thing that makes this film incredibly different than the others is the jokes. All the jokes are an elaborative comic sketches that takes energy along with time for it to work, from you. And then there is the end of the tunnel in the City Lights. A purely unconditional and innocent act that penetrates your emotion as that good old symbol of love arrow does. The birds fly and sing by merrily."

            "review": "Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever, Chaplin brought his \"Little Fellow\" out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture. The Tramp is trapped in a factory, performing mind-numbing repetitive tasks, and finally he goes hilariously berserk. I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons. Like \"City Lights,\" this film is a collection of charming vignettes, this time revolving around The Tramp's desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard. From the Tramp's encounter with an assembly-line \"feeding machine\" to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter, this movie is packed full of delights. Chaplin never speaks, but he does sing a little. This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking."

It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.\n\nModern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most.\n\nOverall, wonderful, another one of Chaplin's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I used to think these movies were just fluff, focusing on comedy but not having any substance beyond that. I was mistaken and found that Chaplin can pull off a well-told story and blend it with seriously funny moments as it goes. There is a lot to appreciate in this movie and ponder upon. One of the interesting things I found interesting is that this might be Chaplin's only science fiction movie with its representation of certain technologies. If that's the case then it is up there in my list of sci-fi movies. If you are just getting into Charlie Chaplin, this is one of the best movies to start with but, really, every Chaplin movie is a great way to start Chaplin."

Later, moreover, Chaplin will be heavily attacked by the government on charges of being a communist sympathizer.\n\nI liked the film, and its story full of hope and good humor, but also full of sharp criticisms of the labor system, unbridled capitalism and the lack of social support for those in need. Chaplin is excellent, but Paulette Goddard is not. In addition to looking old for the role, she doesn't fit well with Chaplin. But he easily overcomes that and completely dominates the film, to the point of overshadowing the actress and everything else with her antics and acrobatics.\n\nTechnically, the film is very well done and very elegant. It is probably one of the last classic silent films, since when it came out the spoken cinema was about ten years old and silent cinema was clearly doomed to disappear."

The list of the best filmmaker never needed any update.\n\nModern Times\n\nCharlie Chaplin is in his prime stage now. Now as in then when the film came out. And prime stage as in both, his narrative skills and performance. Today we're not going to boast about the social and political satire and other changes that the film deals with. But the body language that takes place in this film. The importance of this universal language is something we all know and understand. And here it spews wonder like some winning rap in a rap battle does. And I don't mean the obvious visual galore that is captured by camera tricks to serve the humor and wow factor. But I am talking about just Charlie's control over his body.\n\nHe is insanely in command of his body. There is not a fumble, not a trip, not a wave that is accidental. Even when he is.. nay, especially when he is out of control, he is still dancing the dance of his life. And I say that for the images that he could not be in charge of. As in, he doesn't just do his stunts or whatever you may like to call it, only once but does it frequently, does it fast, does it smooth.\n\nExcept for that dive in the shallow water, he is giving meticulous set pieces that are emotionally motivated, continuously. Now, coming back to the theme of Modern Times. I don't want to use the term ahead of its time, but it is. And its maturity and philosophy is why it remains to be one of my favourite Charlie Chaplin adventures. The love story looks like an excuse, just as it should be. The sacrificial act isn't actually sacrificial. To me, it was a proposal. A proposal to be a friend. A good hard working friend."

Directed, written by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. The film boldly made statements that at the time would have been, very controversial, and remain relevant today. However, the film is at its most impressive when one considers the care, and shear brilliance that went into the making of this film.\r\nIt seems straightforward to call Modern Times a Formalist Film, the ideas take clear precedence, while the narrative is very character driven. To further that, it would seem the main purpose of this film is to make a statement, technology and the business like approach of filmmaking are ruining the art form, however it\u2019s ingeniously hidden behind hilarious humor. The fact that the statement is so well hidden makes it all the more powerful when you realize what it is. For instance people who staunchly disagree with that opinion could laugh at, and enjoy this film without even knowing the film is making this statement.\r\nThe motifs are ones that don\u2019t age poorly as some may. Chaplin chose such vague areas, that we can watch today and relate many arguments to modern day film issues. For instance the technology argument is still present today in the form of \u201cDigital Filming v. Film Reels\u201d, or \u201cComputer Generated Images v. Practical Effects.\u201d, etc., both modern arguments hold similar issues with the \u201cTalkie v. Silent\u201d argument of the 1930\u2019s.\r\nChaplin consistently shows motifs such as the outcast being exiled for a more uniform approach (the black sheep imagery helps parallel this), the overly complicated, often dysfunctional way Chaplin sees technology , or his pessimism towards society, through a showing of eternal optimism. It\u2019s similar to when a filmmaker makes you empathize with a character you\u2019ve grown to hate. All of these motifs are subtly hidden under hilarious gags, so they don\u2019t feel preachy, or heavy handed. This approach requires care, and talent, some of the best directors today can\u2019t even send a message as subtly as Chaplin did.\r\nPart of the reason Chaplin did so well hiding his views was his ability to, for the most part argue his point objectively. By that time colors were being used to influence audience opinions, red made audiences feel uncomfortable, while blue emphasized happiness, Chaplin avoided any colors. Not only did Chaplin avoid coloring his film, he showed the contrasting views, something most filmmakers wouldn\u2019t do.\r\nIt\u2019s the brilliant subtlety, and balance that makes Modern Times such a great piece of art. Chaplin carefully crafted a film with a message, but made his film enjoyable for all, which is a true accomplishment. It\u2019s truly amazing to see a film that can send a message through the opposite viewpoint,  and I can\u2019t stress how truly brilliant it is."

I'm no enemy of free enterprise (even though I'm about to sound like one), but if anything could turn me into a flag-waving communist, it's this oldie but goodie. Chaplin\u2019s indictment of industrialization, crony capitalism, and the exploitation of workers (symbolized not-so-subtly by a herd of sheep, one notable black one among them), Modern Times must have profoundly resonated with a Depression-era population desperate for work and often left to feel like mere cogs in the Great Industrial Machine - in the Tramp's case, literally.\r\n\r\nAs in Metropolis, business magnates look for cheaper and better ways to squeeze the most out of their workers. We also see a female freedom fighter working tirelessly to defend the socially-disadvantaged masses while struggling to put bread on her own table. This is a world in which there is no middle class, just a handful of Richie Riches and everyone else. (Sound familiar?) To be an \"employee\" is to barely subsist, which means you might just have to turn to a life of crime if you want to feed your family. Who cares if you go to jail, Chaplin concludes, at least that way you eat. The poor guy doesn\u2019t want much, just a job that pays a decent wage and a home he won\u2019t lose to the bank. Filthy socialist!\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s something else we should notice here. The fact that a man as well-off as Chaplin could tell a probing story about working class problems suggests that there was, once upon a time, an era when the wealthy registered enough concern about the rich-poor divide to talk honestly about it. A stark reminder that our experiment with democracy and social welfare over the past couple of centuries has been short-lived and that the rich and powerful will always find a way to build million-dollar condos atop the carcasses of the poor **** who helped get them there.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I love money. I just hope my humanity doesn't drown if I find myself swimming in it.\r\n\r\nHER:\r\nAnd he does it again! Chaplin had an undeniable knack for combining laughs, a well-constructed plot, and a great big heart in all of his films. Case in point: a midpoint scene in which a former co-worker robs the department store the Tramp is now guarding, claiming not to be a criminal and just needing to feed his family. It's a moment that has you chuckling one minute and fighting tears, the next. Classic Chappy!\r\n\r\nThe opening assembly line scene isn't just a classic, it's farkin' hilarious, as funny today as it was 80 years ago, showing that when it came to comedy, Chaplin just got it. I also love that he rather consistently steers away from reducing his female characters to props, choosing instead to give them strong, decisive and, dare I say, equal importance in his stories.\r\n\r\nIt was heartbreaking to learn of the opposition Chaplin faced during the second half of his career thanks to Senator Joseph McCarthy and all of his friends. But maybe the persecution he endured was part of what made him such a brilliant storyteller, who knows? Either way his films still resonate as some of the most creative, honest and authentically human of the twentieth century. Discovering great movies like Modern Times was exactly why we started this blog. Thank you, Charlie!\r\n\r\n****/2014/04/modern-times-1936.html"

After being subjected to a crack pot inventor's machine, intended to feed employees while they work, the Tramp suffers a breakdown, which causes havoc for man and machine alike. After being mistaken for a communist supporter leading a parade down a street, the Tramp is put in jail, where, after a heroic act, is set free to pursue a life of unemployment. Seeing jail as a better alternative to starvation, the Tramp attempts to return to jail. Meanwhile he meets a Gamin (Paulette Goddard) and they set out to start a new life together.\nModern Times is a significant film for several reasons. It was originally going to be Chaplin's first talkie as the Tramp, it acted as Chaplin's social comment on the depression era, and it is considered the last silent film from that era. In the end, Modern Times became a mix of silent film and talkie, but in keeping with Chaplin's cleverness, all dialog (except for one scene) is spoken through machines. The factory president barks orders at his workers from big screens throughout the factory (a predecessor of the all-seeing \"big brother\"), a salesman presents a recording of his sales pitch, and voices are heard over a radio. There are also several sounds presented in the film, such as whistles, dogs, and gunshots. This is also the only time the Tramp speaks, but as expected from Chaplin, the Tramp's only audible dialog is a song of gibberish (which Chaplin chose to make sure the dialog could be understood (or not understood) by all people).\nWith Chaplin's Tramp character, he shows how much control his has over his body and why he's one of the greats of physical comedy. Many of the jokes seem overdone, since they've been mimiced endlessly in Hollywood through the years, but it's still easy to appreciate the level of physical control and demand Chaplin commands in his performance. Chaplin's female co-star, Paulette Goddard is no slouch either as she's right along with him in many scenes and proves a worthy companion. There's one particular scene in the factory when the Tramp gets caught in the gears of a large machine, it's like a choreographed dance with the inner-workings **** machine.\nIf you're new to Chaplin or have been a fan for years, Modern Times is an insightful and entertaining romp through an era of beginnings and endings, and what better tour guide than the lovable Tramp.\nDVD/Blu-ray Features\nApart from a great transfer of this classic film, the DVD/Blu-ray release boasts a handful of extras, including an intro by David Robinson, the insightful 26 minute documentary with Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne titled Chaplin Today: Modern Times, deleted scenes, Modern Times karaoke, photo gallery, and trailer reel."

            "review": "At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended."

In the beginning I hated him I wanted him to suffer because he was such an insufferable break, but I begin to get sympathy for him and he was really sad when he slowly got tortured .What I enjoyed most about the performances was how over the top they could be like. Seeing the most angry Frau on a person and Mozart making the most hilarious laughs. It just went to 10 most of the time which were amazing for this time period because it feels like it was a play for how what's the top everything **** way the characters act to the music love it.

It is rich on technical aspects like costume design, production design, background score, make-up design and editing. The script is elaborate, satisfying and justified thoroughly through the complex character's perspective whose narration is the window of writer where it can be and is brutally honest and clears up all that is hoax and distraction. Peter Shaffer; the writer, has done an appreciative work on writing this finely detailed script that is full of tactics but is surpassed by its brilliant execution by Milos Forman whose work pays off well in here. The performance objective is scored majestically by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, in their parallel role are doing some of their best work. The build up to the scrutiny of the politics in here is the key that is developed well enough to lure the audience in. Amadeus dances on the beat rhythmically and stay true to the tone of the feature for around 160 minutes, which doesn't happen often."

Tom Hulce plays Mozart and gives a very great charisma to the character with a comical tone and a raucous laugh but who has an amazing talent about music, unfortunately in more complex works so salieri manages to fill this genius of mozart And how revolutionary he was for his time and that made him have an inevitable envy for mozart so much that he spoke that God chose mozart to be the bearer of his voice passed by his musica.entao so is shown the life of the two until death Of mozart that occurred when he was still 35 years old and even after his death we see that salieri is not happy to feel jealous of his sins against mozart. A great and very well-made workmanship, a great photograph and a perfect soundtrack with mozart and salieri compositions, the costumes and the ambiance are perfects and instantly remembers the time in which the film **** general amadeus is great movie that tells a good biographical history (even if it is not true, it is said that salieri and mozart were friends and salieri was more famous than mozart in his time) .with sure a great request for lovers of classical music And mozart itself.note 100"

Though the accuracy of the film is certainly not 100%, it still proves to be an entertaining and informative biopics that manages to keep you wrapped up for all three hours (I saw the director's cut). F. Murray Abraham is great as Mozart's jealous rival Salieri, but to me, the real star here was Elizabeth Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife. In an innocent, vulnerable, strong, and entirely powerful performance, she manages to keep Mozart focused and keep him grounded, while also doing the same for the viewer. She is marvelous here and turns in an entirely enchanting performance. Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart, does well, but his performance is incredibly over the top and that proves to be a bit annoying at times. In no surprise, the music in the film is truly incredible and enrapturing. The production design and costume design are also top of the line. Finally, the direction from Milos Forman is grand in scale and phenomenal. This one was told quite well and really worked on multiple levels. A riveting film from beginning to end, Amadeus stands tall as a great biopic."

Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance).\r\n\r\nThe costumes and settings are spot on as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. (This is one place independent film doesn't hold a candle to Hollywood). With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife the supporting cast is excellent (especially Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the 2nd like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.)\r\n\r\nThe plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart not himself this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered.\r\n\r\nBesides Berridge's performance there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of either Mozart's work or some of the pieces that invariably made him immortal (It's a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his 5th and 9th symphonies.)\r\n\r\nThe movie is also bit long and drags some in the middle. In one scene during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. At 2 hours 40 minutes it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from myself."

Gradually, the tone turned darker as Mozart turned inwards for inspiration, losing his boyish charm in the process. The music composed during this period was the most compelling. But his rival dogs his every step, sabotaging his success by using his influence at the court. Unlike some of the musicals which give me a headache afterwards, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because there was ample humour and dialogue between the musical pieces. I have never enjoyed opera but here I could not get enough of it, for there is no denying that Mozart is a freaking genius. I had never had a full dosage of Mozart before I watched the movie and I'm glad I got introduced to his work in its full swing. For the naive viewer, this is a piece of fiction and you should take it like that. There is no evidence that Mozart's career turned out as it is depicted in this movie. It is based on a play by the famous Russian poet Pushkin, whose life could also do with a dramatic film."

Amadeus is not a film about Mozart, played flamboyantly by Tom Hulce; it's a film about his contemporary Antonio Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham as a sort of composer-everyman. The film's plot is largely fictional, with its earliest source in Alexandr Pushkin's 1830 Mozart and Salieri. Salieri blames God for meting out the greatest gift He could offer a composer, genius, with cruel unfairness. Salieri feels he's a devoted servant of God, via his music. But comes Mozart, in Salieri's eyes a pagan who nonetheless creates, sans effort, music Salieri knows to be genius -- this \"idle loafer\" (per Pushkin) has been granted God's gift. Salieri can't accept this injustice, and he plots Mozart's death, all the while hearing the voice of God in Mozart's art. Herein, Amadeus tackles two eternal themes in man's relationship with genius. The seeming arbitrariness of genius -- placed in select hands -- belittles ordinary men. Yet the product of genius raises ordinary men beyond the brutalities of worldly existence. Most of us are mediocrities mocked and enlightened by some form of genius we don't fully comprehend. Accordingly, Salieri's mission takes on ironic motive: \"I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint.\" Taking a step back, should genius be stamped out because it's inegalitarian by nature, or relished because it enlightens the vulgar masses of which we're a part? Director Milos Forman allows both possibilities to play out brilliantly. And from Forman there are deeper questions, as the Czechoslovakian-born director lost his parents in the Holocaust and emigrated to the U.S. when the Soviets invaded his homeland. Most specifically, does genius have the potential to save men from themselves and their worst collective impulses? At its heart, Amadeus asserts, emphatically, that it does."

            "review": "As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the \"french\" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it \"the most philosophical of all movies\" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended."

Having been fortunate enough to have watched the final cut in cinemas, I have to say Apocalypse Now is truly an experience like none other. Its hard to pin down what makes the movie so extraordinary; whether its the impressively put together sets (particularly during the flight of the Valkyries), the breathtaking shots of silhouetted figures in the dark of the jungle, or even the phenomenal use of 'The End' by The Doors at both the beginning and the end of the film. Roughly six months after initial viewing I decided to watch 'Hearts of Darkness', a documentary on the infamous shooting of the movie shot by Coppola's wife Eleanor. It gave me some insight into the chaos that occurred during filming, and the madness that ensued. Martin Sheen, who played Captain Willard, badly wounded his hand upon accidentally breaking the mirror upon shooting the first scene. Drunk and drenched his blood, he then continued to act out the scene in a much more convincing manner that brought out the insanity and misery the of actor and character alike. This is one of the many examples of how each of the members of the cast gradually completely lost their minds, and as a result, were absolutely phenomenal. Even Marlon Brando and Dennis Hopper, who are only introduced in the final act of the film, really give it their all. The dialogue in the film (and also the monologues from Sheen), is also fantastic and really gives you a solid understanding of each of the characters. For example; Lt. Colonel Kilgore (played by Robert Duvall), is an insane, reckless warmongering leader who amongst the screams of dying Vietnamese innocents, can only think about whether or not the waves are suitable for surfing. His heartless insensitive attitude is summed up really well by the line \"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning\", although to my understanding Duvall came up with that line himself. Unfortunately there are a few issues I find with film. The most recent cuts of the movie have added a notable amount of new footage, most of which is great, but I find issue with the whole French family sequence. The idea was to show that despite the fact the war is going on, some people still refuse to accept it, and due to their stubborn nature, dismiss the idea of leaving the country. I understand the sentiment, and that Coppola put a lot of effort into creating these scenes (which is probably why he added it back), but the fact is that they aren't that interesting and completely break up the pacing. However I won't let that detract from the overall score, as this issue isn't present in the theatrical release.\n\nApocalypse Now, is in my opinion nothing short of a masterpiece. Thanks to its haunting narrative, exceptional acting, impressive sets, extraordinary pacing, fantastic use of music and beautiful cinematography, it has become one of if not my favorite move of all time."

Francis says, hands down forty years to just begin with.\n\nApocalypse Now\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola might possibly the only director whose multiple films come under hot debates like, \"Which film should be considered the best among the entire cinematic history?\" It goes without saying that Apocalypse Now is a top contender. And not for the amount of work that went just in production and post production- the editing factor is still the most changingly controversial aspect of the film, there have been three versions where actually none of them matches the huge length of the original shot. Leaving all those post success debates behind, the film in its entirety is a battle for sure; mind you, I am taking all the versions into account and also no matter what I say, some of this or all of this has already been said about this classic over the years and even generations.\n\nThe film communicates the threat of the battle by challenging its audience first and foremost. And you'd think that it is not fair, since the film is the one with the voice and the stage. Francis even describes this unfair advantage in the narration by changing the perspective of the viewers about war. And the horror strikes you then, when you realize how easy the war was.\n\nHow Francis has crafted the most sinister deeds easily accessible. The chilling sound effects of the helicopter is your secondary concern, the primary is its ability to mask itself as God and snatch the basic rights of a civilization. Another thing to note here is how the terror of war is not only expressed as a form of an attack but a defence mechanism too. The most natural instinct is burned to an infernal excuse to breathe. Easily, the film is not for everyone. It makes you think how completely different certificate should be allowed to such classics."

But, if I were to try my hand at doing so, I'd say that it really, truly is all of the aforementioned. It's nightmarish, eerie, undeniably well-performed, incredibly well-staged, and featuring some supremely keen set piece design. There's almost nothing about this movie that doesn't feel like it could have been made yesterday. Except for the music. Yes, I'm going to be that guy. And, no, I'm not talking about the brilliant, temporally evocative usage of The Doors' classic hit, \"The End.\" I'm mostly just talking about the synth-heavy score, which -- although ahead of its time as per the film's release -- simply isn't as timeless as everything else on display. Still though, the overall experience is nothing short of revelatory. If you've been busy being a fool like I've been for the past two decades and haven't seen this; get to work. You won't soon forget any of it."

                    "review": "Francis Ford Coppola played the sorcerer's apprentice in this movie but, contrary to what happened with the legendary apprentice, the magic went very well. But this film is not about reality or the real Vietnam War. We may regard it as a parody or a joke, but I think its deeper than that, its a statement of the director's opinion regarding the war, in particular Vietnam. And Coppola's statement is crystal clear: war was a total disaster where thousands of Americans died in vain and any war is always the apocalypse. Coppola wanted to give the public a view of this through this movies and we can prove this not only by the shocking graphic violence that punctuates it but also by the dystopic form as the conflict is portrayed and narrated. This way of facing the war is also evident in some of the dialogues. Its as if the war transformed the human being into the worst and raw of the animals, according to Coppola's mind. At first, the film was largely softened with various cuts but, recently, a DVD with an extended version appeared on the market. I understand the reasons: at the time, Vietnam was a hot topic, Coppola wanted to raise awareness and show what he thought about it but he might not want to hurt social morality. But today things are different. The scenes with the Playboy bunnies, however, seem to be left in the film, though they look as animalistic as the soldiers, as if they were objects and not real women.\n\nThe film features an extraordinary Marlon Brando (for me, it is his best film after \"The Godfather\") and a good Martin Sheen, alongside Robert Duvall (who would specialize in action films and hard characters), Laurence Fishburne , Harrison Ford (still far from ****), Dennis Hopper and Scott Glenn. All the actors have been quite well. The film has a constantly very heavy environment and the combat scenes were filmed quite realistically. I know some older people who have been at war (not in Vietnam but in Portuguese Africa) and cannot stand it because they feel again at war and awakens traumatic memories. So I'll leave the warning: if you cannot handle violent movies, if you're sensitive, suggestible or underage, do not watch this movie. Giving good advice never hurts, does it?"

The classy yet intense editing, the beautiful yet upsetting cinematography, and the fluid yet disturbing camera movements and shots, all have a major role in conveying the message of the movie. The violence could have been more powerful and gritty, but that's not what Coppola wanted, he wanted to show the horror of war by depicting it as an annoying and irritating experience. Unfortunately, the movie could have been way better. There are many sub-plots that could have been used in a way that adds to the main plot by emphasizes on the moral dilemma of the movie. That's exactly what made the ending falls flat, at least for me. Instead of being one of the greatest endings ever, I found it kinda cheesy!\n\n(8/10)"

                    "review": "In one of the scenes that have been added to Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now,\" Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) smokes opium with a French widow (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment) who lives in the crumbling imperial grandeur of her family's remote jungle rubber plantation. As Willard falls into a glassy-eyed stupor, and she slowly disrobes, the woman talks about her husband, a lost soldier in France's doomed colonial adventure, and about the essential dualism of human nature. \"There are two of you,\" she says, \"one that loves and one that kills.\"\r\n\r\nVariations on this theme surface from time to time over the three hours that make up \"Apocalypse Now Redux,\" the expanded version of Mr. Coppola's 1979 film that opens today. The United States Army general who sends Willard upriver into Cambodia to find the mysterious Colonel Kurtz muses on the \"conflict in every human heart between rational and irrational, good and evil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Willard arrives at the tribal encampment that Kurtz rules like a mad deity incarnate, he encounters a manic American photographer, played by Dennis Hopper, who instructs him in the basics of \"dialectic logic\": \"You either love someone or you hate them.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie itself \u2014 shot over 16 months in the Philippines in circumstances by now as myth-shrouded as the story it tells \u2014 is similarly bifurcated, split between its immediate historical subject, the Vietnam War, and a grand, murky ambition to plumb the metaphysical heart of darkness. Whether it succeeds on either level has been a subject of debate at least since the film was unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival 22 years ago. Is \"Apocalypse Now\" a great Vietnam movie? Is it a worthy adaptation of \"Heart of Darkness,\" the Joseph Conrad novella that is its putative source? Does its attempt to fuse 19th-century literature and 20th- century history hold together or fly apart at the seams?\r\n\r\nCuriously, the passage of time has rendered these questions moot. Or to put it another way, \"Apocalypse Now,\" in spite of its limited perspective on Vietnam, its churning, term- paperish exploration of Conrad and the near incoherence of its ending, is a great movie. It grows richer and stranger with each viewing, and the restoration of scenes left in the cutting room two decades ago has only added to its sublimity.\r\n\r\n\"Apocalypse Now Redux\" arrives in this slack season to remind us of a lost era of visionary cinema, a time of creative self-confidence that frequently flirted with hubris, but also a time of risk taking and high seriousness. The artistic vision on display in \"Apocalypse Now\" \u2014 the divine madness that inspired Mr. Coppola to risk his health, his sanity, his fortune and the well-being of his cast, crew and family \u2014 is ultimately less impressive, and less important to the film's durable power, than the art itself.\r\n\r\nAnd while the film may have been the apotheosis (and also the catastrophe) of American auteurism \u2014 the notion that a movie is above all the personal statement of its director \u2014 the achievement is not Mr. Coppola's alone. The script, which he wrote with John Milius, is a succession of vivid Dantesque vignettes that organize the absurdity, the cruelty and the hallucinatory randomness of jungle combat into a compact, episodic nightmare epic. With the exception of Michael Herr's uneven, self-consciously literary voice-over narration, the story is embedded, and embodied, in sounds and images: in Dean Tavoularis's production design, Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, Walter Murch's sound, and the voices and faces of its cast.\r\n\r\nThe current vogue for digitally enhanced, computer-generated special effects in live-action movies, and for jumpy, gestural editing, has lulled us into a pixelated, hyperactive slumber. \"Apocalypse Now Redux\" jolts us awake. The sequence in which Willard and his crew encounter a surfing-obsessed, Wagner-drunk air cavalry commander named Kilgore (Robert Duvall) could stand by itself as one of the best war movies ever, a rigorously choreographed spectacle of chaos and mayhem in which every line of dialogue is audible amid the gunfire and chopper blades.\r\n\r\nTo see the real helicopters swooping through actual space and exploding on the ground, to watch the villagers scrambling to avoid death from above is, in the summer of \"Pearl Harbor,\" to feel a rush of nostalgia mixed in with terror and exhilaration. The old, cumbersome analog machinery, the handicraft of cutting and splicing what the camera has captured, impart a clarity and precision that the new technology has yet to match."

Alternately a brilliant and bizarre film, Francis Coppola\u2019s four year \u2018work in progress\u2019 offers the definitive validation to the old saw, \u201cwar is hell.\u201d Coppola\u2019s vision of Hell-on-Earth hews closely to Joseph Conrad\u2019s novella \u201cHeart of Darkness,\u201d and therein lies the film\u2019s principal commercial defect. An exhilarating action-adventure exercise for two-thirds of its 139 minutes, \u201cApocalypse\u201d abruptly shifts to surrealistic symbolism for its denouement. Result will be many spectators left in the lurch, a factor that won\u2019t help in recouping the $50,000,000 or more necessary for break-even by distrib United Artists, Coppola and the worldwide territorial distribs involved.\r\n\r\n\u201cApocalypse Now\u201d will also have trouble avoiding political pigeonholing, since it\u2019s the first film to directly excoriate US involvement in the Indochina war. To be sure, inhumane attitudes surfaced on both sides as inevitable consequences of a misunderstood conflict, but Coppola wields a wide tabrush in painting Americans as either \u201cconspiratorial\u201d or \u201chomicidal,\u201d with no one in between.\r\n\r\nThus it seems ironic that the most widely heralded production of the last 10 years may find its niche co-opted by a pic dealing with a common subject, the effect of the Vietnam conflict on its participants, \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d and \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d are widely differing treatments in tone and viewpoint, but in the eyes of the film-going public, if you\u2019ve seen one Vietnam war pic, you might have seen them all.\r\n\r\nWhich possible reaction would be a shame, because Coppola here reaffirms his stature as a top filmmaker. \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d takes realistic cinema to a new extreme \u2013 Coppola virtually creates World War III on screen.\r\n\r\nThere are no models or miniatures, no tank work, nor process screens for the airborne sequences. The resulting footage outclasses any war pic made to date. Coppola\u2019s wisest decision was to narrow the focus on the members of the patrol boat crew entrusted with taking Intelligence assassin Martin Sheen on a hazardous mission upriver into Cambodia. There Sheen hopes to track down and \u2018terminate with extreme prejudice\u2019 Marlon Brando, a megalomaniac officer whose methods and motives have become, in Pentagonese, \u2018unsound,\u2019 as he leads an army of Montagnard tribesmen on random genocide missions.\r\n\r\nInteraction of Sheen and the two black (Albert Hall, Larry Fishburne) and two white (Fred Forrest and Sam Bottoms) seamen gives \u201cApocalypse\u201d a narrative flow when, in fact, there\u2019s very little narrative (Sheen has a sporadic voice-over commentary done in groggy sotto-voce that does little to explicate the action).\r\n\r\nRobert Duvall appears mid-way as an expansive screen character, an air cavalry helicopter commander who\u2019s a surfing nut, and has his boys riding the waves in the midst of flak attacks. These and some other-worldly, nighttime river excursions seem the principal contributions of original scenarist John Milius (who now shares screenwriting credit with Coppola), and they contain a wacky, manic energy that serves \u201cApocalypse\u201d well.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s when the ghost of novelist Joseph Conrad enters the picture, and when Milius and Coppola in effect take a back seat to a literary homage, that \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d runs aground. Despite Vittorio Storaro\u2019s haunting imagery, Barry Malkin\u2019s explosive editing, and Dean Tavoularis\u2019 eerie production design, final third of the pic fails to jell.\r\n\r\nExperience is almost a psychedelic one\u2013unfortunately, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s psyche, and without a copy of crib notes for the Conrad novel, today\u2019s mass audience may be hard put to understand just what is going on, or intended.\r\n\r\nMarlon Brando\u2019s intimidating but inscrutable performance as the bald-headed Colonel Kurtz (named after Conrad\u2019s character in \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d) doesn\u2019t clarify anything.\r\n\r\nRest of the cast is extraordinary, with Sheen extremely effective in a laconic style, and Forrest Hall, Fishburne and Bottoms superb in their respective delineations.\r\n\r\n\u201cApocalypse Now\u201d is emblazoned with firsts: a 70mm presentation without credits, a director putting himself personally on the hook for the film\u2019s $18 million cost overrun, and then obtaining rights to the pic in perpetuity, and a revolutionary sound system that adds immeasurably to the film\u2019s impact.\r\n\r\nEven if Coppola isn\u2019t haunted by the spectre of financial fiascos like \u201cCleopatra,\u201d there\u2019s no assured future for \u201cApocalypse.\u201d It\u2019s a complex, demanding, highly intelligent piece of work, coming into a marketplace that does not always embrace those qualities."

It is a movie that keeps playing in your head reminding you about its eerie characters, haunting and almost hypnotic tone. The movie, is however, definitely not perfect. I actually ended up watching the Redux version of the movie which is 3hr 16min long and definitely found it to be too long. I felt that there were some aspects that could have been skipped and played less importance to the overall effect of the movie but later also felt that maybe these aspects were essential in order to completely understand the Vietnam War. However, the movie definitely dragged considerably in its middle portions and became a bit repetitive. Apart from its lengthy pace, however, \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 is nearly perfect as a film. The moments of action are amazing, the narration pitch perfect, the cinematography top - notch and the characters striking. The first and last hour of the movie actually is exceptionally engaging due credit to its characters and dialogue also. \u2018Coppola\u2019 impressively integrates different characters and adds humor to the movie in the first hour in particular. \u2018Duvail\u2019s\u2019 performance as \u2018Colonel Bill Kilgore\u2019 in  particular is terrific in the first hour and adds the right measure of **** and humor in the story. The segment of story involving his platoons attack on a Vietnamese village is terrifically staged, shot and executed. A sequence in particular involving the helicopter attacks with music playing in the background is stylishly shot and extremely memorable. The supporting characters in the movie also make a considerable mark especially \u2018Forrest\u2019s\u2019 \u2018Chef\u2019 and \u2018Bottoms\u2019 \u2018Lance\u2019. The supporting characters add humor in good measure to the heavy story and keep the movie amusing towards the movie\u2019s weak second hour. The performances and scenes are well complemented by some exceptional cinematography and great direction. The last hour of the movie is what remained with me the most after the movie got over. The last segment of the story involving \u2018Sheen\u2019 and \u2018Brando\u2019 is emotionally haunting and psychotically moving. The set up for \u2018Brando\u2019s\u2019 \u2018Kurtz\u2019 is so effective that once his character shows up in the movie, I was instantly intrigued by him. His haunting character is complemented by a terrific performance by \u2018Brando\u2019 who literally scared me with every word he uttered. Lastly, \u2018Sheen\u2019 as the protagonist \u2018Willard\u2019 is also pretty terrific and lends immense credibility to a character which is difficult to sympathize with. \u2018Sheen\u2019 makes the character believable and brings out the angst and frustration of war very well.\r\nOverall, \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 is a very true and harrowing display of the Americans experience in the Vietnamese war. The movie has some terrific performances, terrific direction, unpredictability  and an overall haunting tone to it which stayed with me after I had watched the movie. The reason the movie falls from being a true great for me is because of its weak middle portion which dragged considerably and diluted the movies overall effect."

                    "review": "Since its 1979 release, Apocalypse Now has been widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential films about the Vietnam War. Were it not for the final thirty minutes, I might agree. There's little doubt that the bulk of the movie, which features actor Martin Sheen's trek from the normality of Saigon to the backwaters of Cambodia, is compelling material. But Apocalypse Now falls apart with the arrival of Marlon Brando. Putting aside the simple fact that the ending is anticlimactic and disappointing, the picture's final half-hour is borderline-incoherent, badly written, and highlights a pair of poorly realized performances (Brando and Dennis Hopper).\r\n\r\nIn 2001, director Francis Ford Coppola returned to the footage of Apocalypse Now and assembled a new cut, which he christened with the lugubrious title of Apocalypse Now Redux. Approximately 50 minutes of additional footage was inserted, 90% of which added little to or actually detracted from the plot. There are a couple of new scenes that are important, but they are overwhelmed by two lengthy exhibitions of bad acting, bare breasts, and verbal diarrhea. The original Apocalypse Now clocked in at about 2 1/2 hours - long, but not unreasonably so (although I would argue that the length of Brando's appearance should have been cut to resemble his extended cameo in Superman, which arrived in theaters a year earlier). Apocalypse Now Redux drags on for more than 3 1/3 hours; the bloated size of the director's cut is matched only by the ego of the man who assembled it and the girth of the best-known actor.\r\n\r\nThe essential story, which is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, is straightforward. Coppola's goal with Apocalypse Now is twofold: to display something of the absurdity or war and to provide evidence of what it turns human beings into. In the process, the director provides a vivid understanding of why the United States lost the war. Unlike other Vietnam films, such as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now is neither highly politicized nor especially controversial. With a notable exception (the sampan massacre), it does not dwell on American atrocities perpetrated upon the indigenous population. In fact, the Vietnamese are at best supporting characters. They show up occasionally, but the movie isn't really about them. In fact, few changes would be necessary to re-locate the story to almost any other setting with a long river surrounded by a hostile jungle. That, after all, was the premise of Conrad's book.\r\n\r\nThe troubles encountered by Coppola during filming have been exhaustively documented. The shoot, originally scheduled to last about 4 1/2 months, stretched to 16 months. A typhoon temporarily halted filming and devastated the area. Martin Sheen suffered nearly-fatal health problems. Marlon Brando arrived substantially overweight and insisted that he only be filmed in shadow, where his waistline could be hidden from the camera. Drug use and adultery were rampant. Coppola nearly lost his mind. One could argue that the behind-the-scenes story is more compelling that what ended up in the movie. George Hickenlooper's 1991 film, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, documents the shoot, using cast and crew interviews and footage shot by Coppola's wife, Eleanor, to offer a starting look inside the madness of the production. Considering the chaos of the shoot, it's no surprise that the ending of Apocalypse Now is so incoherent and fuzzily focused.\r\n\r\nThe trip up the Nung River is powerful and haunting, and captures the essential insanity of war in a way that other films, including remarkable efforts like The Bridge on the River Kwai and Platoon, have been unable to do. This war isn't about winning or losing, or even surviving. It's about remaining sane.  It's about entering a world that is almost prehistoric and not losing oneself. When it comes to presenting the movie's theme, the Kurtz scenes are redundant. They merely reiterate what Coppola delineates during the boat trip.\r\n\r\nWhile I recommend the original theatrical cut of Apocalypse Now as it is in my top 10 films of all time, I cannot be as positive about Apocalypse Now Redux. The longer, re-edited version is a dud compared to its older sibling, killing momentum with badly-acted, wordy, dull sequences. The primary value of having Redux available is to illustrate how more can be less. Despite having 20 years of down-time for tinkering, Coppola has not been able to improve upon the product of instinct and necessity that reached screens in 1979. Apocalypse Now is one of those flawed films that contains enough masterful sequences to compel a viewer. Redux is merely a curiosity, and of interest only to those die-hards who believe this movie to be one of the greatest pictures ever to be projected in a theater."

At least in my opinion however, the two-and-a-half-hour-long depiction of war\u2019s atrocities is not that great when regarded simply as a film; it\u2019s much more a work of art, drastically showcasing the futility of this notorious bloodshed, resulting in millions of casualties over its duration of almost 20 years. Apocalypse Now fuels hatred and incomprehension for these happenings in the audience and makes a major pacifistic statement through the metaphorical journey of one man. But apart from the stunning cinematography, the 1979 epic lacks some cinematic traits to make it a thoroughly thrilling and rewatchable experience and can thus not get a top rating from me when regarded as a film."

Everyone knows war is **** but this movie is taking it too far by creating ridiculous scenarios. It's got something going for it though. The acting is good and there is a feeling of mystery as they venture further and further into the jungle. Sadly apocalypse now feels like a dokudrama on drugs and fails to provoke anything but boredom, intrigue and despise. Maybe that was what it wanted to do, but I surely didn't enjoy it."

Shosanna Dreyfus (M\u00e9lanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname \"The Bear Jew\" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."

Der Anfang, angelehnt an klassische Western was Kameraf\u00fchrung, Kulisse und Inszenierung betrifft ist meisterhaft. Oberst Landa gespielt von Christoph Waltz bis da noch ein relativ unbekannter Schauspieler, liefert eine unglaubliche Performance ab. Man k\u00f6nnte einen Drei Stunden Vortrag \u00fcber diese Figur des Oberst Landa halten obwohl er nur eine Screen Time von vielleicht 30 Minuten hat. Christoph Waltz frisst mit seinem Schauspiel die Szenen auf und spielt seine Schauspielkollegen in den Schatten. Die Handlung simpel, eine Rachestory mit einem Hauch von Spionagefilm. So interessant erz\u00e4hlt das man durchweg am Ball bleibt und ein Tarantino Finale was wieder v\u00f6llig ausufert, im positiven  Sinn.\n\nIch h\u00e4tte nicht gedacht das man eine Szene wo zwei Leute Apfelstrudel essen, spannend gestalten k\u00f6nnte. Dieser Film hat mir das Gegenteil bewiesen. Eine der besten Szenen der Filmgeschichte, meiner Meinung nach.\n\nIch mache hier jetzt mal Schluss. Schaut diesen Film!!!!!"

Although I liked it a lot, I think it's probably not for everyone. The ending was really cool, but by the time we get to it, we have long hours of talking that, while I wasn't bored, probably won't be to everyone's taste. However, the film appealed to me, so I was entertained the whole time, and I'm not some Tarantino fan. I like his films, but I don't buy them as much as others and the likes of Pulp Fiction are overrated in my opinion. Purely my opinion. Otherwise, nothing against it. I'm going somewhere else. Anyway, I was entertained from start to finish, probably mostly because of the setting of the time period, because I enjoy the war period in film, so it appealed to me. For me, a great film that I would recommend to fans of war themes, but especially to Tarantino fans."

It has a great cast, really dark humour and the story is nearly perfectly interwoven with the characters to create a memorable experience. It is a war movie set in World War 2 but pretty unique in this regard. I promise you a refreshing and enjoyable movie unlike all you expect.  Story: There are multiple arcs that connect. There is Shosanna who hides her Jewish heritage to survive **** occupation in Paris and wants revenge for her family. There is lieutenant Aldo Rains called the Apache and his Basterds who are a Jewish-American commando unit behind enemies lines. He demands 100 **** scalps from everyone of his man and they strike fear into all their enemies with this. There is Frederick Zoller a German sniper who became famed for his incredible last stand against the allied soldiers. Finally there is Hans Landa an SS officer who enjoys what he is doing and is as smart as cunning. Together their stories create a great overall experience. I truly enjoyed the story. It is told in chapters and I like the style in telling smaller stories that accumulate into a great final. It was excellent from start to finish and rarely were we this impressed by a movie. Simply the best work of Quentin Tarantino. Actors: This is the other great strength of the movie. They have such a great cast that enjoys their roles and director Quentin Tarantino gets the best out of them. Lets start with Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine. He is such a rascal, charming and devilish while also being a father for his man. A fantastic performance. I continue with Christopher Waltz who rightfully won the Oscar for his role as Hans Landa. He is amazingly good and owns each scene he is in. A magnificent bastard. I must praise Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus. Such a great performance and sadly she is not rewarded enough. Then there are the Basterds who are amazing too with Eli Roth as Donny Donowitz nicknamed as the Bear Jew, Til Schweiger as Hugo Stiglitz whose talent is trained by the Basterds or Benjamin Novak as Smithson Utvich (Little Man) to just name a view. I think Daniel Br\u00fchl as Fredreick Zoller and Diane Kruger as Brigit von Hammersack round up the great performance. I must point out that I do not find a weak performance in the movie. Only a few movies do such a great job in combining the characters so good into the story. Director. I already praised Quentin Tarantino and say it is his best work so far. Visuals / soundtrack: Everything in the movie looks authentic and believable. Again I do not know how historical accurate this is but it does not matter in an entertainment movie. The style is convincing and immersive. The soundtrack uses a lot of tracks from the legend Ennio Morricone. This works well and enhances the movie. Also there are tracks from David Bowie, Zarah Leander and other bigger names. A truly good soundtrack and Oscar worthy for me even if he lost at the awards. Lastly I want to praise the (dark) humour in this. There are many mean situations that are entertaining. Overall this is an excellent movie and so enjoyable to watch. In my circle of friends it is regarded as best movie from Quentin Tarantino. An easy must see recommendation for me. Bonus knowledge (Can be a spoiler for some): The difference in showing the number 3 is true and would immediately be noticed by any German. I do however not know why it is different."

Though the film is set in France during the Second World War, it isn't concerned at all with historical accuracy. Instead, it's concerned with a squad of Jewish American soldiers (and a French Jewish woman), who are both on a mission to take out the German high command. The movie is wildly entertaining, sometimes serious, often humorous, but never boring. The violent action sequences will keep you entertained, as well as the scenes of riveting dialogue. The performances are stellar, in particular Christoph Waltz as Colonel Landa. This movie may not be for everyone, but it is definitely a must-watch if you're a fan of Q.T."

What I once viewed as a **** killing romp is now showing so clearly to me as a criticism of war movies and flat out war and blanket vilification in general. A large majority of this movie glorifies the killing of **** with triumphant music and over exaggerated sound and visual effects all the way until the climax. At that point we are shown portions ****  propaganda film screening where **** in the crowd gleefully revel in the pictured killing of American soldiers. Quite a similar behavior to that which the movie has caused the audience to experience up until this point. To really nail home this point, once the **** theater is set ablaze and the basterds open fire on them like fish in a barrel, we are shown this scene through the exact same framing as the **** propaganda showed its hero: a solider in a crow's nest picking off the enemy below set to triumphant music. The criticism here is clear and I love it. (please excuse me for how late I am to properly interpreting this movie). I can't believe I missed it ~10 years ago. Tarantino even goes one step further past his criticism in the final scene wherein he clearly draws a line that shows this film does not sympathize with **** in any way. THAT is not the message he wants to convey and it's an increasingly important line to draw as the film ages, unfortunately. I was pleasantly surprised at how many scenes/shots from IB are burned into my brain. The eyes beneath the floorboards, the scooping of the cream, the inferno of maniacal laughter --I love it all. And I'm sure I don't need to retread all of the other reasons this film is incredible. This re-watch may have just bumped this into my all time top 10. I don't ave a single complaint and 2.5 hour flew by. It's on Netflix right now."

            "review": "After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"

This movie is long but it never feels so as you're constantly at the edge of your seat as the atmosphere of despair plays on any hope of things being fixed. It's a historic moment in history where 22 movies that remained a box office mainstay without faltering reaches both the end and beginning of it's story. The film juggles it's expansive cast and arcs as well as it could despite visible missteps and plot holes it will forever remain one of the most gratifying movie going experiences of the 10's"

Upon arriving at a what they think is a human colony, they make a shocking discover for which they are not prepared.\n\nAliens largely forgoes the slow-paced horror of its predecessor in favour of all out action, and whilst that makes for a very different movie, it is one of those rare sequels that is just as good as the original. Sigourney Weaver is again fantastic, both as an action star and during the more emotional scenes, and the amazing visuals still largely hold up to this day.

The first film was a claustrophobic suspenseful horror film and this is an intense action film. They are both equally entertaining. The vast majority of the special effects are convincing and realistic, my only gripe is the rear-screen projection as it looks washed-out compared to the foreground. There is so much truly stunning cinematography. Sound design continues the epic memorable trend set by the first film. The most memorable being the pulse rifle sounds. Characters are memorable and interesting except maybe Newt who can get a little annoying but overall that is a minor gripe. There are some truly awesome moments in the story that is perfectly told. The special edition is better than the theatrical version but it is very long! I love the action and evolution of the series. It is exciting and fun. I do usually prefer suspense to action. I loved most of the old-school ambitious effects. More action than horror, not a bad thing, very good action at that."

Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Often given as the example of when sequels out-do the original (although that can be argued).\n\nAliens' 2 1/2 run time never outstays its welcome as James Cameron smashes from one set piece to the next as we follow a rag tag bunch of marines with a reluctant Elen Ripley in toe as they head back to LV-426 from the first film to find out what the hell is going on down there.\n\nThis film absolutely rocks! It's script is snappy delivering endlessly quotable dialogue, the special effects still look awesome and the imagery designed by Giger still shocks and disgusts to this day. The cast features the standard Cameron recruits including an excellent Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton who arguably steals every scene he is in.\n\nAliens is a film that took its source material and revolutionised it acting as a framework for how movie sequels should be made. Not just a re-hash but a reimagining. It is a shame many film makers don't pay attention to the lessons learnt here.\n\nFor any science fiction fan this is mandatory viewing."

While Scott's film had a thriller imprint in fact the alien was one only and you could only see it at the end of the movie. Here Cameron shoots a real action movie set in space actually. The Aliens multiply and the action scenes that see our astronauts fighting against the Xenomorphs are many and are all masterfully directed."

While Alien is pure science fiction horror Aliens is more science fiction / action with horror elements. It continues Ellen Ripleys story. After surviving the events of Alien she drifted in space for 57 years until she is found by another ship. After telling her story no one believes her and she is turned into an outcast. However she got the information that on the moon where the eggs were found a colony was established. After the contact with the colony is lost she is recruited for investigation together with a group of space marines. So starts the story. It is intense, has great action, suspense and creates this feeling of distrust and dread that makes this movie remarkable. The menace is so intense that you are lost in the immersion. The great actors / acting increase this effect. Again Sigourney Weaver delivers an awesome performance as Ellen Ripley. Michael Biehn as Dwayne Hicks is equally awesome and became one of the most acclaimed characters in the franchise. Must I even praise Lance Hendriksen as Bishop? He is a great actor and he nailed his role. Special praise also to Carrie Henn as newt. Good child actors are rare and deserve even more praise. If I think about it this movie has a lot of favorite characters of the franchise so I can call it the gold standard all other movies will be compared to. Of cause I must also praise and mention James Cameron as director and writer and Gale Anne Hurd as producer. They tired to make something a bit different than the original while staying also true to it. There are so many cases in changing too much and pissing off fans in movies, videogames or books. Here it works and was acclaimed by fans and critics. Then there are the sets and Alien design. They did again a great job in delivering the mundane of science fiction that looks natural and believable. The Alien design were from H. R. Giger from the first movie except one that was done by James Cameron himself. These effects and care made the difference. Everything looks whole. Overall this is again a cult classic and must see. It cemented the status of the franchise and is one of the rare sequels that rivals the original movie."

Aliens was directed in 1986 by James Cameron who brought us The Terminator and Terminator 2....... Aliens see's the return of Sigourney Weaver from the original and she's teamed up with a group of elite high tech colonial marines to blast the alien creatures to hell. Full of violence, gore, explosions, gunfire, humour and bad language I'd say Aliens pretty much hits the spot and delivers but even though it's one of the best films ever made in film history and I think highly of it it's still not as good as Alien which is the original but it's still pretty good. Aliens also stars Michael Biehn, William Hope, Bill Paxton and other cast members..."

She is the biggest puppet ever made for a film and required several people to operate, creating a terrifying creature in the process.\n\nThe soundtrack is suspenseful, and James Honer did an amazing job with this!\n\nJames Cameron did a FANTASTIC job working on a movie, and being a writer of this movie! It has astounding and funny catchphrases such as Game Over, Man! Game Over!.\nSigourney Weaver is WAY awesome, even powerful than he was, in the first movie.\n\nIt is so amazing, that it's one of the best sci-fi and ''Alien'' movies, of all time, if not so.\n\nWe will follow up to ''Alien 3'', and ''Alien'' Resurrection soon.\n\nHope you like my review. :)"

            "review": "Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

When a brutal terrorist and member of The League of Shadows known only as Bane (Tom Hardy) begins to put his stamp on the city, Bruce is forced to become Batman once more. Tasked with repairing both his mind and body, with the help of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the mysterious Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), Batman must put a stop to Bane\u2019s plans if he wishes to save Gotham.Woven into The Dark Night Rises\u2019 narrative is an understanding of everything this version of Batman has faced. Each chapter of Nolan\u2019s trilogy is its own story, but rooted throughout is Bruce Wayne\u2019s strength, resilience, rage and fear, none of which are more prevalent than in this concluding episode. Now physically frail and broken, eight years have passed since Batman took down The Joker and he is neither the man nor hero he once was, but with Bane threatening Gotham, the Dark Knight must return.Moulded by darkness and being a fellow member of The League of Shadows, Bane is equipped with a devastating plan and excels in the dirty work; he is Gotham\u2019s terror. Following in Heath Ledger\u2019s footsteps as a popular DC villain, Hardy gives an iconic, transformative performance.Introduced as a new love interest for Bruce is Marion Cotillard\u2019s Miranda, an executive on the Wayne Enterprises board. Initially only interested in business and his fusion project, she soon becomes important to Bruce. Also joining Nolan\u2019s impressive cast, is Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s Detective Blake, a young cop working for Commissioner Gordon.

Tom Hardy produces one of the best Bane performances we are ever likely to see and one of the top 5 villain performances we\u2019ve ever seen on screen. Most of the time we see him is iconic and many of his lines are quote worthy it\u2019s a special performance, the sequence where he breaks Batman\u2019s back is a moment of pure destruction. His rise to power in Gotham is monumental and a true showing of how powerful this monster is, making him one of the most devastating and iconic villains we\u2019ve ever seen.  Big fan of Anne Hathaways portrayal of Cat Woman. She makes a tremendous supporting act and her relationship with Batman/Bruce is a fascinating watch, would of loved a stand-alone Anne Hathaway cat woman movie. The football stadium scene just wow, it\u2019s uncanny how good the stadium blow up looks and that\u2019s probably because some of it is real, just with cgi layered in over the top. I always find the worst special effects the ones that struggle blending in with reality, when your scene starts from a real place like this it\u2019s easier to make it seemless like Nolan achieves. Seeing Batman rise from the pits of hell in Banes prison is masterful filmmaking the tension, the anger, the belief all culminated together from the prisoners and Batman makes such a captivating watch.  The final hour is honestly some of the finest work from any CBM it\u2019s breathtaking, there\u2019s real action, major story arc conclusions, twists, betrayals, perfect story telling with an awesome score and one of the best casting lineups who all deliver masterful performances it\u2019s a 10/10 movie and an epic conclusion to one of the greatest trilogy\u2019s"

It has several stellar performances that bring tension and depth to the narrative.Nolan wrote a very thought-provoking story with themes that other superhero movies don\u2019t really explore - it\u2019s basically what makes Bane so compelling as a villain. He sees the rot in Gotham\u2019s system and society and brands himself as some twisted savior. Tom Hardy shines - especially through his menacing eyes and low-key shady **** supporting cast are phenomenal, everyone dials in an extremely strong **** real hero of this movie is actually its technical craft. It is such an excellent audio-visual presentation. It\u2019s tightly edited and doesn\u2019t lose momentum despite its lengthy runtime. Hans Zimmer KILLS it with the score and the SFX work on the low notes and bass rumbling throughout the movie is pretty much what maintains and elevates tension throughout. The cinematography is vast in scale. Although it doesn\u2019t use the full IMAX ratio, sequences look big in scale and the hard color grading make this movie gorgeous. The opening plane hijacking and final battle in snowy Gotham are the highlights.I watched this movie for the first time in 6 years. Since then we\u2019ve had many excellent superhero movies from the MCU and DCEU along with 2 other Batman adaptations. This movie is special. It not only captures that hallmark Batman magic with some good old fist fights and chase sequences but it is full of great social commentary and powerful themes of societal collapse that\u2019ll make this movie timeless. These themes are especially noted in today\u2019s age with everything happening in the world"

I have watched this film before, as I studied this film for film class on the focus of noir style. As a neo-noir film, this film has it all - stark lighting effects, shadows, femme fatale, etc. Watching this film from an angle of entertainment, this film is incredible, but moreover, this film is incredibly to dive into from an analytical angle. When I first watched this film, I was fascinated as to how accurate, yet subtle the noir tropes are in this film, and the style simply blew me away. On a second watch, I am still equally as amazed, yet also fascinated by the story and it\u2019s progression. I was a huge fan of the continuous foreshadowing this film utilised, for example the foreshadowed ending, the child of Ra\u2019s Ahl Ghul, etc. I was completely invested and amazed at how well everything was structured and paced. Overall, even upon rewatch The Dark Knight Rises is an incredible superhero film, and I was just as invested in this film as before. Christopher Nolan really stands out as a great director, and the acting in this film is phenomenal.

But it turned it into the most bitter sequel that could be made and left a lot of questions.\nFor example, we see Bruce paralyzed in the movie, but with the help of some gadgets, he was able to stand up again! And this issue continues to be forgotten and not addressed at all.\nNow, the movie doesn't learn from its two biggest faults in the previous movie and makes them more severe! That is, we witness that there was no Bruce for 8 years!!! So what did you do during this time with the common thieves that I mentioned in the previous review?\nThe rush of the movie to show zero to the hero's loss is over. What does that mean? It means that Bruce has not been around for 8 years and now he has returned with the help of some gadgets to do his duty (which he has not done in these 8 years). He turns and loses his property. When he fights against that threat, he breaks his back and is imprisoned. He finds a doctor to fix his back and comes back and defeats Bane and apparently dies!!! The volume of the story is over for one episode to the detriment of the film.\nThe new character of the movie, John Blake, is not bad. I'll correct it: he's very good, but there's a problem: first, he knew at a glance that Bruce is Batman, and no other explanation was given! Second, at the end of the movie, we find out that he's the same Robin! Well, first of all, all 5 Robins In the world of comics, they are children. Second, if they make a mistake, they are either crude or childish. You are a policeman and have a house for yourself!!! And Bruce, even though he knew this, gave him the key to Batman's cave. And this means curd!!!\nUnlike the first movie, where we had a great twist from Ra's Al Ghul, here the case of his daughter is narrated in the worst way: Bane is an evil person who is stronger than Batman in every way and banishes her to a dungeon and it seems that she is the same child who Jumped out of the dungeon. This means that he is Ras Al Ghul's child and his destiny, and this is a good thing. But we understand that Miranda Tate, who does not have a correct background and is not understandable, is the same Ras Al Ghul's child. In this way, Bane's motivation for evil is ruined and the villain of the story is dragged into the mud. .\nHowever, the acting of the actors, the action sequence and loyalty in the film are shown in the best way. But it is a pity that the script is full of holes and closes the case of this trilogy..."

I love the opening scene on the plane. Then all the way to the end and the nod and the new Dark Knight rising.\n\nBut, a few things elsewhere had me drop that half star.\n\nMichael Caine is outstanding here. It's probably his best performance in the trilogy.\n\nHathaway and Cotillard are great additions too and the flip from Bane to Talia is still so well handled.\n\nHardy as Bane is phenomenal. The fight scene in the sewers with absolutely zero score is so well handled.\n\nNolan definitely watched this a few years ago and thought, I need to make that atomic bomb actually happen "

We don\u2019t get that much Batman but more of Bruce Wayne. Remember when Peter Parker was struggling with his powers in Spider Man 2 this is the same scenario but it\u2019s different. Tom Hardy as Bane is definitely the best part of the movie! Joseph Gordon Levitt gets some time to shine as well his character was great! I still get a lot of goosebumps throughout the movie because theres moments in here that are so beautiful! The Dark Knight trilogy is one of the best franchises of all time! All 3 films are so amazing it\u2019s so hard to rank them! Nolan gave us an amazing finale to The Dark Knight trilogy! Call me a Nolan fanboy if you want but I will forever defend his movies! Hans Zimmers score is again amazing! The supporting cast is spectacular alongside Anne Hathaway! The Dark Knight Rises is a flawless film! I\u2019ve seen the trilogy a hundred times and I never get bored of it"

Where Begins grasps me emotionally on a primal level, and TDK moved me into shock and awe, Rises blends both of those worlds together, but also blends into this feeling of euphoria, like this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life. A legend who\u2019s marked his place in history, risen out of the darkness (mentally & psychically), and become a symbol of hope for all of those who are still searching for the light. A coda much deserving of any and all praise. And the entire finale nearly had some tears flowing this time, especially with Alfred standing over Bruce\u2019s grave.

            "review": "I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's \"The Conversation.\"  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  At first there are so many questions--why the self mutilation?  Why are these people treating this man this way?  Where is he?  How did he get there?  Who does he work for?  Does he actually work for anyone?  And yet, how skillfully is is all done.  I suppose if you want to begin nit picking, you can come up with a few inconsistencies.  This doesn't detract from the way that the principle character floats from even to even, trying to recoup his memory each time he faces the day.  The one thing I will grant is the emotional investment required for revenge--but because he is aware of his shortcomings, he feels he must act.  If  you are bored with most movies these days, rent this and it will affect you for a long time."

Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.\n\nAs always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.\n\nNolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.\n\nIt is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.\n\nGuy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.\n\nOverall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I liked that some of the scenes are shown in black and white, giving it a sort of retro feel and a clinical sense to it.\n\nIts a hard film to describe - I suppose its quirky.

This continuous alternation between the two stories (one in color and one in black and white) that proceed in opposite temporal directions deliberately creates that sense of disorientation for the viewer, very similar to that experienced by our protagonist.

The main minus of the film for me is that it's just not the feast for the eyes that we experience with new Nolan films. Don't look for breathtaking effects here.

And he does it by raising a simple question. How far should you go as a storyteller to express yourself and communicate coherently to your viewers? In this case, it is evidently reported for 8 years to put all this puzzled work in one big crime scene. Leanord (Guy Pearce) is suffering from short term memory loss and for a guy who can barely survive going through his own routine, he has embarked himself to cross a big revengeful mountain.\n\nTo be honest, the film does most of its magic on paper. What's to wonder about is, Nolan who used props and elements for the style in Following, has now cornered himself into being obliged to use those same props. But this is Nolan, he doesn't bow down to such limitations in the script. He has simply jumbled up the events for some levity and uses it to give you enough reason to hang on to this trippy ride. Once again, the editing gets a shout out, But I'd also like to mention Nolan's choice of picturization of those abstract yet contextual repetitive part of the act. He hides the facts by acknowledging the fact that he is hiding it. Nolan has confessed that he loved using the similar picturization of both the flashbacks and real time screenplay that he learned from Terrence Malick's style, especially from The Thin Red Line.\n\nLet's follow the lead character Leonard and Pearce embodying a tattooed (scarred) personality as such. The bluff of Nolan is how to make him sympathetic that goes unnoticed in the film. His handicapped part of the personality is abused over and over by the other characters that actually mirrors their own figure, and as a result you are worried sick and exhausted by this experience. And Pearce plays it simply as Nolan reveals it in the \"guilty\" section of the storytelling, later in the film. The assumption is what leads us into this misunderstanding. Not the props, not the Memento."

The whole story revolves around a man who has suffered a brain injury that makes impossible for him to keep long-term memory from that moment on. He is, however, committed to discovering and punishing a murderer, resorting to post-it notes, tattoos and Polaroid photographs, where he notes what he has discovered. Its an interesting concept, later revisited in \"Before I go to Sleep\", film that approaches a similar story. The way the narrative is constructed, with multiple linearity twists, helps to thicken the mystery and hold our attention but it can have the opposite effect on people who don't understand the film right from the start. And this happens because, from the middle, the movie loses rhythm and interest. The ending works well but it can really disappoint, just as it disappointed me. I did not want the ending to be the way it was. Guy Pearce is the protagonist and did a reasonable job, as well as the generality of the cast, but the film is not exactly a dramatic show for any actor. Its worth, essentially, by the original story that tells."

This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense \"writing\"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."

Technically, The Shining may be one of the most perfect motion pictures I have seen. It's too bad that the same level of excellence doesn't extend to the performances and screenplay. The Shining is well worth experiencing, but it does not rank as a member of Kubrick's top echelon of cinematic achievements."

                    "review": "The Shining is originally a psychological horror novel by celebrated American author, Stephen King. The movie is directed by the academy award winning Stanley Kubrick and has a stellar cast including Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and Danny Llyod. The movie is set in Colorado in the late 1970s, though it was shot almost entirely at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Ostensibly a haunted house story, it manages to traverse a multifaceted world of incipient madness, spectral murder and supernatural and not to mention, the jump scares. Before plunging ourselves into the depths of the movie, I would like to point out the absolutely marvellous interior sets used in the movie. Unlike the standard issue horror movie, set in a cramped and dimly lit place with erratic scenes and frenzied editing, Kubrick gives us the colossal fa\u00e7ade of the Overlook Hotel with brilliantly lit and impeccably clean but empty interiors which in itself gives the viewers the creeps. Every little detail is maintained. The simple sounds used gives the viewers chills down the spine as can be heard when Danny rides his tricycle through the empty corridors of the Hotel, the wheels thundering on the wooden floor, while quiet on the carpet. The slow and gripping pace of the movie leaves many viewers cold, as did the nudge-wink craziness of Jack Nicholson as the author who agrees to take care of an isolated hotel and later, in the worst possible sense, of his own family during a long Colorado winter. But the film's power, like that of its setting, seems to have grown on audiences over the years, and three decades on it still exerts a fearsome grip. It's all in the build-up, Kubrick sets the scene for the horror with meticulous care. By the time things start to go wrong, we feel dreadfully intimate with the sprawling Overlook hotel and the menace hidden along its carpeted corridors and in its luridly coloured bedrooms and bathrooms. But the longer running time does increase the sense, both terrible and exhilarating, of being trapped in Kubrick's magnificent, malevolent nightmare, never to escape. The astute use of tension between the central three characters that just builds and builds to an unforgettable climax. The interior of the Overlook Hotel that becomes a character all on it's own with it's baffling structure, disturbing colour palettes, the minutiae in the design work that make you see things that weren't there before, it's like studying a glorious painting uncovering new layers. The central performances are what make this adaptation so unforgettable. Jack Nicholson is at his raw acting best. There's a sense of enervation and irritability behind those wild eyes, you know he's already too far gone by the time they arrive, but his gradual descent into madness is truly horrifying. Shelly Duvall who almost went crazy herself during the film's gruelling and notoriously hostile production, Kubrick\u2019s mistreatment of Duvall elevated her acting and she does a wondrous job, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of the overprotective mother Wendy Torrence. Danny Lloyd who never acted again after this gave the world of cinema, one of the best child performances. Kubrick knew exactly what he was doing and what he wanted. Though it did get stressful at times with him, they all did an exceptional job in making the movie, a chef-d'oeuvre."

The acting choices here are incredible with Jack Nicholson giving a truly demented performance and Shelly Duval in this film is simply spellbinding and one that will be remembered for years to come. Another great performance is from Danny Lloyd creating the greatest child acting movie in film history. In conclusion this masterpiece of a film will be remembered as the greatest horror film of ALL TIME."

We see loads of blood pouring from a elevator lift and Jack Nicholson going crazy and turning into a killer towards his family and the chase involving his son through the hedge made covered in snow plus the Grady twins. Excellent film and very violent. Directed by Kubrick in 1980, also contains bad language."

                    "review": "The Shining is easily one of my all-time favorite horror films, mainly because it doesn't rely on cheap jump-scares or gore/violence; the antagonist never physically hurts the characters on screen, only providing the mere (and very real) threat of violence toward the end. The film also does well by avoiding typical cinematographic tools of the genre: dark lighting, close-up shots, and fast jump cuts, all of which would play on the viewer's fear of the unknown, claustrophobia and anxiety. However, The Shining manages to provide all of these unnerving sensations in scores, despite doing the exact opposite of the typical horror genre, by portraying the Overlook Hotel as brightly as possible, using wide angle shots throughout the film, and by using long, lingering shots of the environment of the Hotel. Director Stanley Kubrick did a marvelous job of putting the viewers at unease by showing the vast expanses of the Hotel in full lighting, assuring the audience that our protagonists are truly alone in the Hotel - until they are not. He also puts sharp, jarring noises (usually reserved for scenes where the killer is lurking in the dark, or when the monster moves past outside the window) throughout the Shining, even when nothing of significance is happening, further playing on the audience's anxiety and keeping them engaged thinking something could happen at any time - although mostly it doesn't, but it still worked in getting my palms perspiring. The Shining is unique in this sense, that it provides some of the most unnerving cinematic experiences in history, and leaves the viewer absolutely terrified and not able to answer why. For these reasons, The Shining gets a 9/10 from me."

Some creepy moments including what Jack Nicholson discovers in the bathtub in room 237 plus the Grady twins and the river of blood gushing from a hotel elevator... Beautifully directed with sometimes amazing scenery especially from the start. The Shining has suspense and horror wrapped in a beautiful red bow and it delivers like no other horror movie has managed to do. Directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1980, The Shining delivers!"

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out.

The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars."

Because he is definitely the best villain in comic book movies and everyone is praising him.\nThe only thing that bothered me a little was that Star-Lord was hitting the water a little aimlessly and he doesn't understand what situation he is in! And he really turns the page, but let's be honest. We were not satisfied.\nIn the end, I can say that I watched this movie more than the end of the game because I loved it from the bottom of my heart and it was full of surprises for me."

WELL, it gets a well deserved 8 from me, just because it did everything we wanted it to do, and much more."

His motivations are my favorite part because he is not just trying to destroy the world. He is also super menacing. The ending was also one of the times I was the most shocked in a comic book movie. If there was one thing I did not like is that some characters did not have enough things to do, like Captain America. But that is only a minor issue. So overall I really liked this movie. I hope marvel will learn from this. Oh wait, captain marvel is after this."

The humour was also working thanks to the Guardian of Galaxy characters and thanks to the adult setting of the movie (so for example Tony Starks didnt annoy us with his arrogance and Spider Man hadnt much scene time with his teenie problems). The villain is much more interesting than in most other Marvell movies.\nThe only thing, that I didnt like was the political correctness."

        "featured-review": {
            "tagline": "One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time",
            "reviewer": "fernandoschiaviJun 27, 2020",
            "review": "It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the \"Star Wars\" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with \"Jaws (1975)\" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) \".Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.In \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though \"Duel\", \"Jaws\" and \"1941\" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg's camera keeping a mystery about Indy's identity - Douglas Slocombe's photograph skillfully covers Ford's face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker's camera game, which is maintained throughout the film's other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg's ability to command the action is present in the most \"naive\" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford's suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy's personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero \"asks\" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: \"I don't know, I invent on the way\". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the clich\u00e9 of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en sc\u00e8ne that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg's brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters' positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist's gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since \"Jaws\", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the \"current times\" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the \"spirits\" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don't think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Ca\u00e7adores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong \"strikes\" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - \"The Raiders of the Lost Ark\" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new."

I have not filled so happy about an adventure movie in such a long time. Just going for smile all the way.\n\nAm I enjoyed the cast they did a bank of job playing kind of two dimensional characters that are still somehow human and interesting.\n\nIt's weird, how many people he kills I mean I really enjoyed it. It's kind of weird. How many other adventure movies has almost no kills, but they were gruesome and I really enjoyed it.\n\nWho takes the show is the production designs and the stuntmen? They are the ones who keeps this movie of the Script is fine and interesting but it is truly the stunts that take this movie to another level and the Charm of the actors."

Die Geschichte findet im Jahr 1936 statt und Dr Jones soll eine Bundeslade besorgen, bevor es die **** haben. Die Bundeslade soll n\u00e4hmlich die Menschen unbesiegbar machen. Bei seiner Reise begleitet ihn die junge Frau Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), seine ehemalige Geliebte.\n\nIndiana Jones ist eine Kultfigur und hat das Abenteuergenre neu erfunden und hat viele andere bekannte Filme inspiriert, z.b. Fluch der Karibik.\nDie Anfangsszene ist die bekannteste Szene aus dem Film und diese kennt wirklich jeder. Diese ist auch meine Lieblingsszene im gesamten Film und zeigt uns wie Indy tickt und was er drauf hat. Indy ist ein intelligenter Abenteurer, welcher die Situationen genau analysiert und versucht nicht in Gefahr zu geraten, was nicht immer gelingt. Es wird uns ebenfalls gezeigt, wovor er Angst hat und das sind Schlangen. Harrison Ford spielt die Rolle sehr gut und er passt perfekt in die Rolle. Einen anderen Schauspieler kann man sich f\u00fcr diese Rolle nicht vorstellen. Es gibt viele Actionszenen und Kampfszenen. Immer mit dabei ist der Humor. Sei es, dass er einen Gegner einfach erschie\u00dft, als mit ihm in den Nahkampf zu gehen oder eine Hakenkreuzfahne als Seil benutzt wird. Die Kampfszenen sind gut gefilmt und sind gut gealtert. Die Orte im Film passen perfekt und sehen sehr sch\u00f6n aus. Das Gleiche gilt f\u00fcr die Requisite, f\u00fcr die fantastischen Sch\u00e4tze, die mit gl\u00e4nzendem Gold versehen sind. Die B\u00f6sewichte sind daf\u00fcr da, damit Indy es nicht einfach hat die Sch\u00e4tze zu bekommen und dass er auch andauert in Gefahr ist. Viel Tiefgang bekommen die B\u00f6sewichte nicht und einen Hauptb\u00f6sewicht gibt es meiner Meinung nach nicht zu sehen. Fast alle Actionszenen sind super und der Film geht ziemlich schnell vorbei. Am Ende wurde mir der Film ein bisschen zu lange.\n\n\nFazit:\nKann ich den Kultstatus nachvollziehen? Auf jeden Fall, die Figur Indiana Jones ist sehr interessant und einer der besten Abenteurerfilme, die es gibt. Die B\u00f6sewichte haben nicht viel Tiefgang bekommen und sind nur als Gefahr da. Der Film ist ziemlich blutig, womit ich nicht gerechnet habe. Die Kampfszenen sind super, au\u00dfer die Verfolgungsjagd mit den Autos, die fand ich eher langweilig und viel zu lange. Indiana Jones: J\u00e4ger des verlorenen Schatzes ist ein super erster Teil eines Franchise und ist kurzweilig und ein spannender Abenteuerfilm.\n\n8,5/10"

There isn't a single frame in the movie that isn't required. The action sequences are thrilling, fast-paced, and visceral; they're among the best of their sort."

It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, **** spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

All together they created a movie (and franchise) that entered pop culture history and is as appalling today as it was back then. Just think about how many times scenes from the movie were used in other media as homage or parody or even both. Even people that never have seen the movie know Indianan Jones. For those who don't know Indianan Jones. He is an archaeologist, adventurer and teaches archaeology at a university. He is a homage to classic heroes while also being a bit of a scoundrel. Because of his character and likeness he became one of the most beloved movie characters of all times. Back to the movie. After one of the best introductions in movie history (wont spoil). Indiana Jones is asked by the American intelligence service agents for help. The **** are putting huge efforts into searching an old artifact. He deduces from the clues that it could be the mystical arc of the covenant. According to legends an army carrying it will be unbeatable. So he is on a journey to get more information and stop them from archiving their goals. This is a start **** story filled with action, humor and remarkable characters. Lets start with the actors. Harrison Ford created his signature role as Indianan Jones and a character that will always be remembered. Karen Allen plays Marion Ravenwood who is Indiana Jones former lover. She is though, smart and an enrichment for the movie. Ronald Lacey as Mayor Toht is such a great diabolical looking and enjoyable villain. He was perfect for the role. Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq is the arch-rival of Indiana Jones. Basically a more ruthless version with no qualms. Then there is John Rhys Davies who I think is a great actor and underappreciated. All together we have an awesome cast. Then we have Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Their ideas, concepts and visions for the movie are remarkable. There are only a few movies that are so wholesome as this one. Everything fits together like the actors, characters, sets, soundtrack, dialogue, humor and story arcs. The special effects were impressive and still deliver. Then we have another legend that is also underappreciated. John Williams who is a legendary film music composer. He created so many memorable and legendary soundtracks. Here he created a masterpiece including the Indiana Jones theme everyone knows. Like I said everything fits well together. Overall this is a timeless classic, a must see movie and easily a contender for the most influential movies of all times list. Bonus knowledge: There is an interesting proposal to evaluate. It says that Indianan Jones has no effect for the outcomes of the movie (except of a  possible timely delay). I thought this was a silly idea and want to disprove it. After a lot of thoughts and analyzing I must admit it is correct. All events will happen with or without him. Only what happens with the lost arc after the conclusion is maybe different (but even this is just a speculation)."

The main theme is one of his best pieces.\n\nThe script sets up an intriguing treasure hunt as archaeologist Indiana Jones goes to all sorts of exotic places looking for the lost Ark of the Covenant. The script can also be pretty funny.\n\nReally good cast. Harrison Ford is the epitome of fun as Indiana Jones. He's smart and tough, but also a likable grump. Karen Allen does a good job as Indy's love interest who manages to go toe-to-toe with him personality-wise. Villains in this are good, too, especially Belloq (Paul Freeman) as Indy's cocky rival and Ronald Lacey as an appropriately slimy ****.\n\nI highly recommend this classic."

This was my first time watching the movie from beginning to end and overall I liked it. It had good characters, great acting (especially from Harrison Ford), fun action, and a great score from John Williams. It does drag a bit in a few areas and, I admit this is just a me issue, but it is a bit too gory in some parts for my taste so if that sort of thing makes you squeamish there\u2019s your advance warning, but I still enjoyed it and am interested in checking out the sequels and seeing the 5th film whenever it gets out of production hell. 7/10 - Recommended."

There is an amazing action scene within the first 10 minutes which I think a lot of movies can learn from.  That scene was the hook.  Indiana and all the players were interesting and multi-layered.  I have seen this movie over 200 times and it is the best movie ever created.  If you haven't seen it, you haven't seen perfection on film."

The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action."

That's how great Peter is in this film.Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!"

I think the story is incredible as well, and now that I've seen it three times, there are so many subtle symbolic images across the plot that make the payoff all the more satisfying. Personally, I think the climax of the film is not when Miles wins, but rather when Miles jumps off the side of that building and we get that jaw-dropping, show-stopping shot of him falling upside down to the night city and swinging through it with confidence. 10/10 no questions asked."

Unfortunately I think the second half was a bit rushed and it still somehow ended on a cliffhanger. Maybe a series would be better than a movie? I don't know, but I really loved it in the end."

Now fast-forward to today with the second movie coming up, I decide to watch it again to prepare myself for that movie and honestly, this movie has aged so beautifully it's remarkable. The first thing it does to make you excited is subvert your expectations when you see some characters, you don't initially think too much about them but then when they're all of a sudden so much more than just random people, it manages to capture you off guard because you're used to talking to people that have no impact and when it turns out they do, they stay with you long after the movie will end. The main cast of characters are all excellent and have amazing and diverse personalities to ensure everyone sticks out and helps you remember everyone so well to help drive the story to 11 and stop it from feeling generic. But also, Miles Morales here might be one of the greatest MCU characters to exist with how he's written and the performance given by the actor is nothing short of amazing. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've heard recently for a movie with how it manages to capture the feeling of hopelessness, being at your lowest point, humor, and excitement so well and never lets go of it. The low frame-rate might look concerning, but with how it compliments the art-style and camera, it's actually not so bad when you look at it in motion. Speaking of the art-style, it's easily the best part about the movie with how gorgeous it is thanks to the varied color palette, bouncy sound effects, and the beautiful animation due to the low frame rate. The easter eggs are simply amazing and are a treat for Spider-Man fans like the Insomniac 2018 suit. Overall, I loved this movie from the top of my heart and has only heightened my excitement for the sequel so much more."

This film takes everything that we love about Spider-Man and creates a fresh and exciting new story that is both visually stunning and emotionally resonant.\n\nThe animation style is unlike anything we've seen before, with a blend of 3D and 2D animation that brings the comic book pages to life. The attention to detail in every frame is astounding, from the character designs to the vibrant colors and backgrounds.\n\nThe story is equally impressive, with a perfect balance of humor, action, and heart. The film introduces us to a diverse array of Spider-People from different dimensions, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Miles Morales, the film's main character, is a wonderful addition to the Spider-Man mythos, and his journey to becoming a hero is both inspiring and relatable.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch, with each actor bringing their character to life with nuance and depth. The soundtrack is also a standout, with a mix of hip-hop and orchestral music that perfectly complements the action onscreen.\n\nOverall, \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is a tour de force of animation and storytelling. It's a film that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages, and it sets a new standard for superhero movies. This is easily one of the best films of 2018, and a must-see for anyone who loves Spider-Man or great filmmaking. 10/10."

Miles has to learn to become the new Spider-man while Spider-people from other universes come over to stop Kingpin running the collider again. The storyline and animation is interesting and fresh at the beginning but gradually loses its shine. > Related media: I have watched all Marvel Cinematic Universe films with Spider-man featured. I have not read the comics or watched the TV shows.\n> Positives: > 1. The story is interesting and fresh, with new characters from other universes.\n> 2. The animation style is new (for me) and well done. Negatives:\n> 1. However, after a while, the animation loses its shine. Most characters are not drawn beautifully, particularly Kingpin. The 'glitch' caused by the multiverse affecting each other is also represented in a style that looks poor to me.\n> 2. The fast parts of some animations can be too much for some people, including myself.\n> 3. Towards the second half of the film, it just felt frustrating, tiring and not that impressive. > How would the different age groups rate this: > Children: Good > Teens: Excellent > Young adults: Excellent\n> Medium-age adults: Good > Older adults: Good. > My rating: 3/5 (no half scores).

It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other.I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form.((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"

This is an anime of legend and will be honored for decades to come. It clearly deserves all the praise it's been given.\n\nThe animation is gorgeous and vibrant. The OST is also wonderful with some haunting and heartbreaking melodies that stir the soul and capture the imagination. Clearly this was a labour of love and that shows.\n\nThe plot is not new and has been done before many times. But the production, editing, pacing and overall writing of the characters is so masterfully done that it becomes it's own. The genre it best falls into is slice-of-life romance with a touch of fantasy. A little bit of a slow burn at the start, but does get momentum pretty quick.\n\nOverall: I can go on and on about this movie (it's a movie, not a series) but in short: it beautiful and a must see for all."

But Makoto Shinkai-in this story of love, despair, redemption, search, and identity-managed to evoke these.\n\nThe story is simply ravishing, and so is the graphic work. The verdant nature of Japanese countryside, the never-sleeping, always busy city of Tokyo. Enrapturing. Although I have heard some strong criticism of the music by RADWIMS, which is by some considered too teen, and inimical to the emotional substance of the story, I found it a perfect match. The sounds complemented more than well the despairs of the characters, and enhanced the visual beauty.\n\nImportantly, this is not only the tale of two Japanese adolescents swapping their bodies. It is the story of Japanese culture and history, tale of the struggle of Japanese youth, and metaphor for the tragedy that hit Japan in 2011. Combining all of these is not an easy task and could easily result in the chaos, yet this movie succeeded in combining these heavy themes in such a gentle, harmonious, and tender way. It was deservedly awarded numerous prizes in Japan and internationally."

The entire body-swapping concept of this movie makes for some humorous and overall fun moments. However, the concept itself is a little confusing and leaves for more questions. Here is where my main and only problem lies with Your Name, and that is the handful of minor plotholes that are sprinkled throughout the movie.\n\nThe main one that is prominent is the romantic development between the female main character, Mitsuha, and the main male character, Taki. A lot of the interactions they have failed to explain the sudden romantic significance that they begin to hold for each other. However, I think this can be glossed over and attributed to their mutual experiences with the whole body-switching fiasco. Either way, to build on this, hyper analyzing this movie will result in a loss of enjoyment. There are a fair number of plotholes, and for a person like me, I don't think that I can just pass over them and give such a high score. To be fair, a movie has only so much runtime, and so many concepts and other rough edges are unable to be fine-tuned in a movie that has to cover as much ground as Your Name.\n\nRegardless, Your Name can be appreciated for what it is from an artistic sense: an absolute masterpiece. The production is some of the best you will ever see, and I truly stand by that statement. It ultimately boils down to what you prefer. If you want a movie that will move you, then watch Your Name. If you are the type to read into details way too often like I am, then Your Name should probably not be your first pick for a movie, but you should still give it a chance, if only for its fantastic artistic presentation."

I like the plot that the boy from the city and the girl from the rural town are switching the bodies. I like how they show their culture in 2 sides (countryside & city). The story was written by Makoto Shinkai. This movie is one of his successful cause it gained a lot of money. The time for this movie is 107 minutes. It is look like the movie is long but actually it is not too long. All the time when I watching this movie, I really curious what will happen next. The illustrators and the animators of this movie are very skilled. The scene of the movie is very beautiful. The sky is very nice. Especially the scene that the comet is separating itself. The character in the movie too , They make very clear emotion of the characters. Some place is used from the real one such as Shinjuku, Shinano-machi station pedestrian bridge and Yotsuya Station. The movie soundtracks of this movie are really good too. That are sung by the Japanese rock band name Radwimps. I can listen the playlist of these songs for month! At last, I know that the characters in this movie, later appeared in Shinkai\u2019s next film \u201cWeathering with you\u201d. I have to clear my time to see his movie! If you haven\u2019t watched this movie yet, you should watch it once in your life!"

The amount of detail, particularly in Tokyo, is insane. It's utterly gorgeous to watch.\n\nThen you have the magnificent story, which is filled to the brim with feeling and meaning. I felt everything that it intended me to. It's also paced to perfection and is told through two memorable characters in Taki (Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki) and Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi).\n\nKamiki and Kamishiraishi are excellent in the lead roles. Of course I don't understand Japanese and was using subtitles, yet I still felt every intended emotion from those two. Class from them. Of the others, Ms. Okudera (Masami Nagasawa) is the one that sticks out most to me.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, you even have a tremendous soundtrack and score to boot. It really does all make for a fantastic viewing experience, one I will be revisiting no doubt and one I would undoubtedly recommend."

                    "review": "Your name was one of the biggest Japanese animation movies to come out in the last decade. I am a huge fan of anime but I never really bothered to watch your name despite all the hype because of other commitments. The premise of the movie is \"Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person\". I finally decided to watch this movie and wanted to see if this movie was deserving of its hype.\n\nFirstly, the animation and art style is so beautiful. Every shot in this movie is visually striking and it is very clear that the director (Makoto Shinkai) and his team were thorough in the detail of Tokyo and the rural countryside. The setting of this movie is based on the real world but it is so gorgeous to look at, that it feels magical. Every little thing in this movie is just so visually pleasing from the **** to the forest to just the characters eating; it's stunning. This movie was definitely robbed by the Oscar for not even nominating the movie. The music is also done by a Japanese band call \"Radwimps\" and it is phenomenal. Their songs are perfectly utilised in the movie and perfectly represents and elevate the emotion of the scene. It's surprising because using vocal pop songs are usually jarring but Your Name does it in such an effective way that the scene wouldn't feel the same without it. The story within this movie sounds cliche with the body-swapping but the way it is executed is so fundamentally different from anything Hollywoods done that it feels unique. Mitsuha is the girl who lives in the rural countryside and is a shrine maiden but wishes to live in Tokyo. Taki is the boy who lives in Tokyo who is a talented artist aspiring to be an architect. They both end up randomly swapping bodies which results in them having to discover why this is happening but also learning about each other along the way. The situation leads to them dealing with each other problems but also discovering more about themselves. Mitsuha and Taki wouldn't interact normally but this event leads to them creating a bond where they both would be irreplaceable to one another. Romance movies are not something I am fond of but Your Name kept me emotionally invested in what was going on. There is some laugh out loud moments that are expected of body-swapping but there are some serious, suspenseful and even genuinely heartwarming moments that tug at my heartstrings. The director masterfully inserts these clashing tones and makes it fit together to complement each other.  There are some twist and unconventional ways to body-swapping done in this movie that sets it apart from other romance or body-swapping movies. On top of that, the characters are absolutely loveable with their quirky personalities. There is also supporting characters who are the friends of Mitsuha and Taki who are just the best people in the world. Overall, the movie is such a wild rollercoaster of emotions. There were so many moments where I was screaming internally because I was so invested in these characters and their situation. The constant message of searching for something or someone is the theme of the movie and it shouldn't resonate but it does. All of this leads to a satisfying finale that by the end I've felt rewarded. I've never been so engaged in a romance movie until Your Name. The fantastically beautiful animation that is weaved together with a very human story with likeable characters leads to what may be the best animation movie in the last decade. This was a sensational experience that everyone should experience themselves."

A dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Makoto Shinkai \u00e9 absolutamente autoral. Aqui temos uma historia de amor que intercala uma fic\u00e7\u00e3o muito bem fundamentada com o universo de jovens contempor\u00e2neos - que vivem em situa\u00e7\u00f5es muito distintas. As dificuldades apresentadas v\u00e3o al\u00e9m da compreens\u00e3o humana, e passam a ser de escalas inimagin\u00e1veis. O Story Telling aqui \u00e9 impec\u00e1vel. Temos transi\u00e7\u00f5es entre os protagonistas e a din\u00e2mica funciona muito bem. A diferen\u00e7a entre o life style dos dois \u00e9 marcante e o diretor sabe muito bem como trabalhar em cima disso com a cenografia e uma fotografia atenta. O mesmo utiliza de v\u00e1rios planos, brinca com as propor\u00e7\u00f5es - dando uma identidade \u00fanica a sua cinematografia-, e trata o filme como um quadro em movimento. Cada plano tem algo a dizer e poderia mesmo ser confundido com uma foto.\n\nA dublagem do filme est\u00e1 excelente. Da primeira vez que assisti, optei pelo idioma de origem, mas ao assistir pela segunda vez, notei que a dublagem brasileira n\u00e3o deixa a desejar, sabendo muito bem como lidar com as tonalidades diferentes sem deixar a obra com um tom muito infantil. O fator replay \u00e9 muito bem desenvolvido. O diretor deixa varias pistas e referencias ao redor da obra, o que valida muito rever o filme. O suspense e o mist\u00e9rio fundamentado nas emo\u00e7\u00f5es dos personagens \u00e9 t\u00e3o bem feito que, mesmo assistindo pela segunda vez, me emocionei e me encontrei em situa\u00e7\u00f5es onde estava ansioso. O desenvolvimento dos personagens \u00e9 org\u00e2nico. Aqui se evitam mon\u00f3logos, e tudo sobre eles est\u00e1 na tela. Todo significado cultural envolvido, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os personagens, as atitudes quanto ao mist\u00e9rio e at\u00e9 mesmo a aceita\u00e7\u00e3o sobre toda aquela situa\u00e7\u00e3o mostra muito bem quem eles s\u00e3o e o que os mesmos pensam.\n\nO plot do filme nos pega de surpresa, eliminando quase toda nossa esperan\u00e7a, nos deixando perdidos e com uma \"interroga\u00e7\u00e3o na cara\". Fico feliz em dizer que o filme apostou bem nessa decis\u00e3o, pois o que poderia ser apenas mais um romance com toques de fic\u00e7\u00e3o, se tornou a historia de amor definitiva.\n\nNota 10."

Also the comet struck the place twice is also very unlikely and have to suspend your believe too much. The town eventually got wiped out, but is it not like groundhog day that they could try to save the town over and over again, until it works? Just with a romantic plot line just doesn't cut it, and the romantic plot is very thin aswell and wasn't enough to get me invested. Very forgettable storyline."

            "review": "I'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.Coco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the \"Day of the Dead\" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. \nQuiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my \"top 10 best movie scenes\" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.I could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.A must see!!!"

                    "review": "\"Coco.\" Released in 2017, this animated gem takes us on a musical journey through Mexican culture and the afterlife. So, let's strum the chords of emotion and dissect what makes \"Coco\" hit all the right notes.\n\nVisual Aesthetics:\nFirst off, let's talk visuals. \"Coco\" is a feast for the eyes, a kaleidoscope of colors and meticulously crafted animation. Pixar once again proves its mastery in creating immersive worlds, and the Land of the Dead is a breathtaking spectacle. The attention to detail, from the marigold petals to the intricacies of the skeletal characters, is nothing short of awe-inspiring. It's a visual fiesta that celebrates the richness of Mexican folklore and tradition.\n\nSoundtrack:\nNow, the soundtrack. Oh, mama, the music in \"Coco\" is like a soul-stirring serenade. The original songs, composed by Michael Giacchino and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, capture the essence of Mexican music with infectious energy. The standout track, \"Remember Me,\" is an emotional powerhouse that tugs at the heartstrings. It's a soundtrack that not only complements the narrative but elevates it to another level, making you want to dance, cry, and celebrate life all at once\n\nStory and Characters:\nLet's dive into the narrative and characters. \"Coco\" follows the journey of Miguel, a young boy with dreams of becoming a musician, as he ventures into the Land of the Dead. The film weaves a poignant tale about family, legacy, and the importance of remembering those who came before us. The characters are richly developed, and the familial dynamics resonate on a universal level. Miguel's journey is both personal and universal, making it a narrative that transcends cultural boundaries.\n\nThemes:\nNow, let's talk themes. \"Coco\" delves into themes of memory, identity, and the power of familial bonds. It explores the idea that our ancestors live on through the memories we keep and the stories we tell. The film does this with a delicate touch, avoiding heavy-handed sentimentality and instead delivering a message that feels genuine and profound.\n\nIn the grand Pixar tapestry, \"Coco\" is a standout thread, a film that not only entertains but educates and resonates on a deeply emotional level. It's a celebration of Mexican culture that doesn't resort to clich\u00e9s or stereotypes but embraces the beauty of tradition and the importance of remembering our roots.\n\nIt's a masterpiece of animation, storytelling, and cultural representation."

I expected 'Coco' to be a Mexican 'Moana' (I was 12 back then, so Disney and Pixar were all same to me), but got something way better. This is one of Pixar's most memorable films- the songs, the worldbuilding, and of course, who can forget the humor, which is unpredictable beyond imagination. A double emotional climax, like the one we got in 'Toy Story 3' is all fine, but where this film excels is in empathy. To me, Pixar stories are all about accepting people for who they are, and this movie goes even further. That's reflected in the fact that this movie celebrates a culture foreign to America. There's a Ghibli movie called 'Grave of the fireflies' that can make a big brother care more for his little sister. 'Coco' is a movie that does the same for one's family. A must-see for all ages, and as a family if possible."

The themes are nice and I suppose very young children may struggle a little to follow all the messages - it could be mildly scary for very young kids but then it does have a PG rating, so that's fair. Its a nice, uplifting and cheery film, even though it very much focuses on the dead - indeed its set during 'la dia de las muerteas', aka 'The Day of the Dead' which is celebrated in Mexico. If you enjoy Pixar films, then I would recommend this film, in terms of the overall feel it gives out - its a bit of a warm hug of a film, as I say re-assuring, nice and not expressly too cinnamon sweet in a bad way. However, if you can't stand CGI animation, then obviously this won't be for you. I also enjoyed the variety of characters, with a rather zany stray/street dog called Dante being one and I also wondered if the inspiration behind the more villainous characters, had been taken from a telenovela (aka latin American soaps).\n\nThis isn't entirely a dumbed-down film and I would highly recommend it for family viewing overall, yes. Oh, and if you enjoy the guitar music, you might want to watch (or shall I say, listen) through the credits while it keeps playing. Its quite soothing and enjoyable."

Pixar have always been leaders in CG animation and let me tell ya', 'Coco' contains some of the best animation to have come out of the studio. All the animators deserve a pat on the back for this project. The opening sequence alone is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Oh man, this one will forever be remembered by those who see it.

The animation syncs so well with all the music especially when characters play guitar; the animation is once again extremely impressive, which has become a cliche to say.  I always cry at the end of this movie, it moves me every time.  This movie is also a great dive into Mexican culture, which was really cool to see.  The skeletons look fantastic.  The Land of the Dead is gorgeous and a really cool world to see.  Coming right after Cars 3, this movie is a huge breath of fresh air.  From here on out, I really enjoy the rest of PIXAR's movies (as of early 2021), and it started with Coco, which I consider to be the start of a PIXAR renaissance."

The music was beautiful and I've been listening to the soundtrack since watching, \"Remember Me' is my favourite track. The story was very predictable from the beginning, it was probably one of the most predictable storylines. However, a younger audience probably wouldn't be able to predict it anyway. I've watched enough Pixar films to predict how they end."

The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.\n\nWe were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)\n\nIt surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. \"there will be no X in this family!\" X being \"instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past\". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them \"mama, I miss you.\"\n\nBeautiful."

A joy of a ride.\n\nI may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town.\n\nOr, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.\n\nI got my wish.\n\nThis is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken.\n\nThis is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.\n\nTo watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.\n\nThank you, Pixar."

Pixar has improved the animation to such a level since 2010 that it is not even possible to comment on how beautiful it is, but it does not forget the story, which is excellent and with a wonderful soundtrack that will draw you into the story. An excellent film that I can recommend."

                    "review": "Coco is a brilliant film! The best thing about it are the songs, especially \"Remember Me\". But really all the songs are very emotional and make people cry just listening to them. This was definitely one of Pixar's most original ideas for a film at that time after just dishing out sequels. Somehow Lee Unkrich has managed to build on that heart-wrenching ending to Toy Story 3 with another movie that's jam-packed with emotion and heart. The opening 30-45 minutes is really what you'd expect to come from Pixar and it's a bit predictable. But the real magic starts when the Land of the dead comes, which is filled with fantastic world-building. The animation is stunning, from the vibrant colors and lights to the splendid reconstruction of a Mexican tradition. The story just brings so many twists and turns from there with a whole family heritage story and an aspiring musician's tale also. The whole Land Of The Dead is done beautifully from the buildings, bridge etc. Its filled throughout with a colorful theme that just makes you feel so happy. The masterpiece in here is the final act, which is by far one of the best of Pixar's films. the \"Remember Me\" song scene is executed perfectly with no musical number, but instead lets you take in the emotion of the moment. Coco is just a sensational film!"

Talvez at\u00e9 a melhor.\n\nDevo admitir que havia um certo tipo de preconceito por minha parte quanto a esse filme. A m\u00fasica, ainda mais abordada de acordo - a priori - com a cultura mexicana, me afastava um pouco. Mas resolvi, com minha namorada, dar uma chance ao filme ap\u00f3s lembrar de uma recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o de um cr\u00edtico que aprecio, e mais uma vez me arrependi de n\u00e3o ter assistido a essa obra antes.\n\nO filme j\u00e1 come\u00e7a nos apresentando o universo daquela fam\u00edlia - que n\u00e3o \u00e9 pequena - e todo seu contexto para que ficasse bem claro que os mesmo n\u00e3o gostam de m\u00fasica. Por\u00e9m, o protagonista deseja muito correr atr\u00e1s do seu sonho, e a trama, que at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o tinha se \"arriscado\" muito, toma propor\u00e7\u00f5es espirituais, abordando muito o dia dos finados e sua influ\u00eancia - vice-versa - na cultura mexicana, e eu adorei a surpresa!!!\n\nPrimeiro de tudo: a fotografia \u00e9 de cair o queixo. As cores vivas d\u00e3o um tom fant\u00e1stico ao filme, e todo o cen\u00e1rio/universo criado ali \u00e9, de novo, de cair o queixo. O trabalho da equipe de identidade visual \u00e9 nota 10. Conseguiram fazer com que esqueletos fossem fofos e emp\u00e1ticos - no que se diz respeito a nossa percep\u00e7\u00e3o. A trilha sonora, junto com suas m\u00fasicas apresentadas no filme, s\u00e3o demasiadamente atrativas e reconfortantes. A dublagem em PT-BR est\u00e1 fant\u00e1stica, como de costume.\n\nPor\u00e9m, o que mais me aproximou do filme foi a trama. Aqui, temos personagens vivos e bem constru\u00eddos. O roteiro sabe muito bem como e quando revelar informa\u00e7\u00f5es importantes para a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos atos, e da conclus\u00e3o, e tamb\u00e9m sabe muito bem o que aquilo vai causar no p\u00fablico. O trabalho feito em torno do mist\u00e9rio e maestral e nos leva a questionamentos org\u00e2nicos e at\u00e9 mesmo divertidos de se imaginar. Eu me emocionei pelo menos 3x ao redor do filme, mas o final me tocou como nenhum filme antes havia feito. Esse filme \u00e9 sobre diversas coisas, e as aborda de maneira t\u00e3o bonita que \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel n\u00e3o se emocionar. Ver o protagonista cantando a m\u00fasica que seu pai cantava pra ela quando crian\u00e7a, ver a fam\u00edlia finalmente sendo toler\u00e1vel aquela arte antes abomin\u00e1vel, ver a senhora falando e entregando o \u00faltimo peda\u00e7o da foto ao bisneto foi demais pra mim. Fora todos os subtemas abordados, como a pr\u00f3pria velhice. No meu caso, tenho passado essa experi\u00eancia com meu cachorro, que hoje tem 14 anos e passa por problemas patol\u00f3gicos e \"naturais\", e ver a senhora daquele jeito consequentemente me lembrava do meu irm\u00e3o que eu tanto amo.\n\nCoco \u00e9 um filme emocionante, divertido, \u00fanico e aborda temas que toda crian\u00e7a deveria ter acesso. Nota 10 e meus mais sinceros: obrigat\u00f3rio a todos os cin\u00e9filos."

The setting revolves around the Land of the Dead (which kinda fits the theme of life-and-death), but you'll really know more about the spirit world (Land of the Dead) once you watched the movie. The cast of characters is so well written, charming and/or humorous. But the visuals for Coco are just fantastic and stunning! You'll appreciate the visuals and art direction more if you watch the \"behind the scenes\" stuff. The music is really memorable and well-executed. There's a lot of pretty good humor (lots more than Ratatouille) and the movie feels like an adventure you'll end up rooting for the characters. Also, to mention the touching moments in the movie could seriously warm your heart, especially the ending, it could really make you cry.\n\nThis film is one of the few movies (so far) that made me cry. The first movie I've cried to was The Iron Giant and the second is Big Hero 6 (in 2014), but dang, it's really been a while since I've cried to any kind of movie. So really, Coco presented its story really well, the visuals were stunning (like Ratatouille), and the music is really memorable. This is a really great movie to watch for kids and maybe both teens and adults, but anyways the score is a... 10! (10)"

Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level. Bravo!"

The way that PIXAR can somehow make me and many others understand the characters and know what Wall-e means when he mostly just says, \u201c Waaaleee,\u201d and,\u201d Evvvvaaa,\u201d is brilliant. I still want a sequel or anything else similar. Watch this if you feel down as it usually helps make me happy seeing Wall-e happy and I hopefully will help you if you\u2019re down."

I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"

There is an innocent joy evident within this film of which theaters have not seen in quite some time. WALL-E's powerful first half involves little dialogue and though some may find it boring, the movie never loses sight of where its going and what it wants to be. The second half is more standard Pixar fare but is enhanced by the attachment we grow towards WALL-E early on in the movie. This movie does not try to dazzle us with special effects or perplex us with a complex plot. The animation, though amazing, and the plot, though interesting, never overtake the characters in terms of importance. Pixar' took two significant risks with this movie: taking a slow approach to the scenes on Earth and having a largely speechless main character. Both paid off handsomely making WALL-E an affecting and enthralling classic."

I asked my mom to let me watch it but since we come from a very conservative family, I wasn't allowed to. We didn't have a TV at home and even when we got one, we didn't have Disney Channel paid on it. So I finally got to see it a few years ago when I was travelling in the metro. And boy this is such a good movie, I'm really disappointed I didn't see it earlier.\nWALL-E is everything we expect from a Pixar movie. It has a central character who is identified by his desire to do something big. He is living alone on a deserted planet, still cleaning up everything because that was his job. His innocence is what makes him so interesting. The movie is also moving forward with character development and world building, which makes us, the viewers, know just as much as WALL-E does. There is nothing that we don't know and a concept comes from out of the blue. The only other Pixar movie I can think of where this happens is Cars.\nThe second important character in the movie is EVE. WALL-E falls in love with her not only because she is also a humanoid robot with a feminine touch and voice, but also because she is the only other creature WALL-E has seen in this post-apocalyptic world. Other than her he has only seen rats and ****, and we have seen how he treats them as a friend too. This is a metaphor of how we see the little things in life when we have nothing to either distract us or to force us to do something else. This is why WALL-E gets so much distressed when EVE puts the plant inside her and switches off, and also why he decides to follow her to space.\nIn space also WALL-E is really confused. He was never designed for space, nor had he ever seen what space looked and felt like. He had also seen the humans physically for the first time, who have deformed to a point where they are no longer recognisable. Speaking of the humans, their bones have gone detached and they are literal jellybeans at this point, who can no longer work. And they are not in a shape to continue working for very long at this rate, which can lead to their extinction. All of this happened because humans didn't care about the planet and focused more on leaving it than fixing it.\nOnce the humans finally reach Earth, they start their civilisation afresh on the abandoned planet. This is the most important message in the movie; it is never too late to redeem yourself. Many people think that the message of the movie is just to preserve the planet, but in my opinion THIS is the true message. Finally EVE and WALL-E unite and they live happily ever after, which makes it the most Pixar movie to ever exist. The animation, music, cinematography, everything is perfect. It is also suitable to people of all ages.\nThis is one of those movies which will be used to define what the animated movies of our era used to be like. It is cool, it is well made, it has a message, it has many fans and it's made by Disney. Plus it has so much emotion. If this is not the perfect Pixar movie, I don't know what is."

It's not hard to get attached to cute robots, but without much dialogue in the first half of the movie, I'm glad that the visual storytelling works so well to get the audience invested in these characters.  The romance in this movie is also handled really well and was super heart-felt by the end of it.

I really don't understand how Pixar could have created this in 2008. A wonderful world with a wonderful atmosphere, in which a robot named WALL-E passes by, who later meets EVE. At a later stage, the film wonderfully shows that modern technologies are fine, but we must not forget to move. The only minus of the film is perhaps the end, which is too much for children, but otherwise it is an amazing spectacle."

I was so moved by it that after the film I just remained stationary for a whole minute, before clapping my hands for pixar's most astonishing achievement. The animation was incredible, the space scenes were just exquisite and the spaceship scene was wonderfully done, with some great creativity behind the making of the whole thing. The opening sequence of Wall-E was stunning. There's no dialogue but even then you're hooked to the story. This film not only sheds a light on pollution and the need to take care of the environment, but also is telling us what the earth in 500 years might be. The chemistry between Wall-e and Eve is brilliant and it also manages to be funny by adding a few hilarious characters in a superb script. Wall-E is a colossal achievement in terms of animation and screenplay for an animated film. This can surely be considered one of Pixar's best, if not the best film."

Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn.

Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned."

One such rare jewel is the Bollywood classic, 'Three Idiots'. This Rajkumar Hirani directed masterpiece is a testament to the beauty and power of cinema, one that transcends the borders of language and culture, speaking in the universal language of the human soul.\n\nAs an American, devoid of any innate knowledge of the Indian language or culture portrayed, the film mesmerized me with its profound storytelling and deeply resonant themes. It serves as an unequivocal reminder that the human experience, despite our diverse backgrounds, remains deeply interconnected. Every frame in this movie is carefully crafted, every dialogue meticulously written, and every character intricately developed, making it one of the most cinematically ingenious works I've had the privilege to encounter.\n\nAt the center of this compelling narrative stands Rancho, portrayed by Aamir Khan, a character so well-rendered that he will go down as one of the greatest heroes in cinema history. Khan breathes life into Rancho, a non-conformist, a messiah figure of sorts, who challenges the status quo and inspires his fellow students to pursue their passions rather than abide by the arbitrary rules set by societal conventions. It's through Rancho that Hirani successfully deconstructs the burdensome expectations of an achievement-focused society, showing us that the key to real success lies in self-belief and unbridled passion.\n\nThis movie fires on all cylinders, with an electrifying screenplay where every word spoken carries weight and meaning, intricately weaving into the larger narrative. It is a testament to the brilliance of the writers that each line of dialogue feels essential, and each subplot contributes to the overall narrative. It's as if you could dissect any scene, any dialogue, and find a world of wisdom embedded within.\n\nThis masterpiece was indeed ahead of its time, so much so that its brilliance was not widely recognized until it was, unfortunately, ripped off by numerous Western directors. But, the beauty and purity of 'Three Idiots' continue to shine through, undimmed. It's a rich tapestry of humor, drama, and life lessons that resonates with audiences worldwide, irrespective of their cultural or language barriers.\n\n'Three Idiots' stands tall as a work of massive genius, an embodiment of cinematic brilliance that will, hopefully, continue to inspire and touch the hearts of many generations to come. We indeed need more 'Ranchos' in the world, characters who teach us to stand against the tide and follow our true calling. This film is more than just entertainment; it is a beacon of hope and a symbol of the transformative power of cinema. 'Three Idiots' truly is a timeless classic that deserves its rightful place among the greats of world cinema."

So the day this movie featured on TV, I watched it. And I have seen it every single time it comes on TV. And afterwards I began laughing at them because I had seen it more number of times than them. But well, immaturity aside, let's review this movie.\n\nThe film talks about the rat race that everyone goes through, that we have been brainwashed into believing ever since we were teenagers. They always tell us that we need to get into a good engineering college if we want to have a good job irrespective of which field we work in, then that will play out when we have to get married, then we will have children and then the cycle will go on for them. We don't dare to think otherwise, because the elders always have a sense of insecurity about us and also because they always resort to shouting and scolding whenever we dare to question their authority.\n\nThe film has become something of a synonym with engineering life. Everyone learnt about the various things that happen in the top engineering college, because I think this is one of the first commercially successful Bollywood films to talk about the environment. There are three protagonists, each being a stereotype of an engineering student we all can relate to - Rancho the brilliant guy who doesn't study much but still gets good marks because he loves what he's doing, Raju who is a superstitious and cowardly guy coming from a poor household, and Farhan, a student who really has a passion for photography but his parents are forcing him to do engineering. Basically the three types of engineering students we all know.\n\nTogether they spend their college life in fun ways, teaching each other the meaning of life and the points of views of each person. And then after they leave college, they all decide to meet each other because of a \"challenge\" that Chatur, a teacher's pet had given them. Chatur wasn't exactly wrong from his point of view, since he came from Uganda, a country where Indians were being persecuted back in the late 20th century. He had learnt early in life that one has to take all means possible in order to achieve success, and that's exactly what he was going with.\n\nEvery time I watch this film I end up managing to find a new detail that I had previously missed. I watch it every time it comes on TV because of that reason. It was only later that I got to know this is actually a book adaptation of Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, and those friends of mine who laughed at me for not having seen this film are the same people who ridicule Chetan Bhagat for his terrible books. And to be honest they are kind of right, since this is his only good book adaptation. And by good I mean absolutely flawless."

The plot is great and depressing while the acting of all the characters is just great, Aamir Khan is a great actor that always does great acting. The humor is well crafted and the drama is carried very well in the movie. The movie has funny and depressing moments that mix to create a powerful experience. There are flaws with the movie and that is that the story is drawn out a bit to long and there is one scene where it is one misfortune and one strange luck act after another in a rather inappropriate scene for children which was most definately not required. Overall \"Three Idiots\" was a great film that is most definately worth watching for it blends drama and comedy into a unique movie. Breakdown for \"3 Idiots\": Presentation: 8.5, Plot: 8.25, Acting: 9, Script: 8.75, Lasting Appeal: 8. Verdict: 8.25 out of 10 \"Great\""

            "review": "What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!"

My favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as Dad and I watched this at midnight and couldn't stop laughing. I loved Sellers also as the man in the wheelchair Strangelove, who tries to impersonate ****, I think. There was a brilliant performance from fine actor George C. Scott, who I really admire. I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent. Got to love the music, I did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. Great movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox"

I liked how the various people, representing different aspects of the US (the military etc.) and other nationalities, are put together in close quarters in the war room, which inevitably lead to some clashes. This isn't the sort of film that offers lots of immediate laughs but I appreciated the quirky characters and there are certainly some rather amusing pieces of dialogue, one famous quote being 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'. I found the phone calls made by various officials particularly amusing. One conversation features an official arguing with the person on the other end of the line that 'I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are' and consequently going off in a huff. There is a pointed sense of immaturity portrayed in the way that such people communicate with one another, which makes you think about the potential childishness, the one up-man ship aspect of war and of political confrontation generally I suppose. I found it somehow amusing that one of the characters kept referring to the Russians as the 'Ruskies'.\n\nI liked the various characters played by Peter Sellers. His characters are, unsurprisingly, quite comical in tone and have an edge of caricature about them. The film has a serious theme (the threat of nuclear war) and it does well at making us think what could happen. It has some distinctly comic moments within the script but it also poses some important questions, makes the viewer see the somewhat sinister side of megalomania and its certainly decent as a piece of thought provoking cinema. The fact its filmed in black and white is also quite well judged, I feel, as it gives it an almost timeless feel to it. The film dates from the mid 1960s, when most films were shot in colour as standard and given the very modern danger that was an all out nuclear war, at the time this film was made and initially released, its perhaps ironic that its shown in a normally quite dated way but it does give it a timeless feel somehow.\n\nThe plot is a bit meandering and it won't appeal to everyone but I'm glad I've seen it twice now as I feel I appreciate it more now and the first time I saw it, I really wasn't in the mood for this type of film (political satire) and indeed I stopped watching after half an hour or so. Given I saw the drama show Catch 20 recently, I could see some similarities and perhaps better understand where its coming from.\n\nI would recommend this to people in the mood for such a film, not an all out laugh a minute comedy or a light and easy watch as such and not for people hoping for constant fast paced action or war scenes but otherwise its a cult classic that I'd say is worth a watch."

A great comedy that makes fun of the meaninglessness of the confrontation of 2 superpowers. The film was shot more than 50 years ago, and is still relevant."

Dr. Strangelove is the best character. \"Mein F\u00fchrer, I can walk!\" One of my favorite films. David Lynch's hair dandruff madness. I would say 1/4 of that episode of the third season of Twin Peaks, where all the timing was showing special effects. But quite insane. Stanley Kubrick is a genius. He is a genius. Genius.

His satirical take on an issue so relevant to society and terrifying to most - at the time - provides a weird look into history seldom found in other films.\nThe reason I'm hesitant to give this film a 10, however, is because of Kubrick's sense of humour. Kubrick finds humour in the stupidity of the film's main characters in such a dire situation. This element can be lost on a lot of viewers. This film is also one that you cannot watch in a casual environment. You have to be paying attention, otherwise, you'll miss out on important details.\nBut, if that's no problem for you, trust me, you're gonna love this film. Peter Sellers manages to successfully portray three so incredibly different characters, all with their own humorous, and sometimes even likeable, traits. George C Scott is incredible as the all-powerful bumbling fool that is General Turdginson, Sterling Hayden as the paranoid Base Commander Jack D Ripper is incredible, and Slim Pickens gives an amazing cowboy-like vibe to Major Kong.\nI love this movie. I appreciate it not only as a history buff, but also as a movie lover. If you're up for the challenge of taking the time to appreciate period-appropriate political satire, I highly recommend you take the hour and a half to enjoy this masterpiece."

The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of america.\r\nIn the mid 1960\u2019s, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of vietnam. Looking at that maybe it\u2019s best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it\u2019s time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits.\r\nThe film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn\u2019t lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it\u2019s easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it.\r\nAs was mentioned earlier the film\u2019s cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick\u2019s opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn\u2019t shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries.\r\nIrony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading \u201cPeace is our Profession\u201d, or Slim Picken\u2019s talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film \u201cGentlemen you can\u2019t fight here, this is the war room.\u201d All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated.\r\nComing at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it\u2019s time."

                    "review": "When you consider the history of motion pictures, certain watershed films leap to mind -- productions which have left their mark on the craft. Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove (or, as it's subtitled, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb). As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen director Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt Peter George's thriller Red Alert for the screen, he recruited the author to help with the script. Instead of retaining the straight tone of the book, Kubrick wanted to try for a black comedy, and with the complicity of George and co-writer Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove was born.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Kubrick envisioned Peter Sellers playing four unique roles. However, after filming three of them (President Merkin Muffley, RAF Group Captain Mandrake, and **** scientist Dr. Strangelove), the actor broke his leg and was unable to complete the quartet. In his place, Slim Pickens was signed to portray Major \"King\" Kong. Other cast members include George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, and James Earl Jones (in his first film role) as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg.\r\n\r\nAs a story chronicling the potential countdown to humanity's end in a nuclear fireball, Dr. Strangelove is tightly-plotted and well-paced. As a black comedy, wielding a wit sharper than honed steel, the film is unparalleled. Kubrick's picture has so many targets that it's difficult to know where to begin. Certainly, the \"balance of power\" nuclear deterrent policy gets the most obvious jabs (although ardent supporters may not see this -- Dr. Strangelove's attacks are subtle enough that it's possible for an unsophisticated viewer to miss the point). Parodying the \"missile gap\" at the heart of the arms race, we are given the \"doomsday gap\" and the \"mine shaft gap.\"\r\n\r\nKubrick isn't especially kind to the military mentality, as personified by General Turgidson (elements of Scott's performance here foreshadow how he would approach the role of Patton in the 1970 movie that earned him an Oscar). Turgidson sees Soviet plots everywhere, flirts with a girlfriend in the midst of a national crisis, believes 10-20 million American casualties (tops!) are acceptable, and wishes the U.S. had some sort of doomsday machine to match the Russians' capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs the film races to its conclusion, situations become more bizarre, with a drunk Soviet Premier Kissoff whining over the phone to Muffley that the U.S. planes are flying too low and jamming his radar. Mandrake tries to put an emergency call through to the President, but the Pentagon won't accept the collect call, and he doesn't have exact change. And Dr. Strangelove, **** best living ally, comes up with a plan to preserve the superior elements of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor. The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm. In fact, I'd worry about anyone who takes this movie too seriously. That, after all, isn't the kind of person Dr. Strangelove is aimed for; it's the kind this film takes aim at."

Luckily, Sellers plays three roles so we get to see a lot of him and he really helped put this one over the top for me. It is amazing to me that this one is still a riot considering that it was released 50 years ago, but it goes to show that good films transcend time and this one fits the bill completely. In addition to being funny, it is a great political thriller as we watch everything unfold in the film. The ending song as the film wraps up was also a phenomenal choice and was a perfect compliment to the things going on on screen."

All I can say is this. In my opinion it's not one of the funniest comedies of all time but I agree it's one of the greatest. This is one of the shortest Kubrick films and probably the most casual to watch which I like. There is a lot of dialogue but it gets pretty entertaining in the second half of the film. And there are a couple of really funny scenes; my highlight is the one where the President is on the phone trying to tell the Russian leader that American planes are going to bomb Russia. And what makes it great also is the comment it makes. This is one of THE cold war films. All the paranoia and suspicion and madness. The ending was the right way to end the film. It should be part of your bucket list of films to watch."

But perhaps his best of the three is the titular character Dr. Strangelove, a former **** scientist who aides the current President of the United States, Merkin Muffley (also played by Sellers) on the basis of the film, where a crazed general (George C. Scott) initiates a first stike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, something which everyone else is now attempting to prevent as this will mean nuclear annihilation.\r\nThe simplicity of the comedy in Dr. Strangelove is visible from the beginning, it isn't a complex plot of drawn out jokes and cringeworthy gags, but the expressions, motions and general dialogue of the characters that truly make it a special film, it doesn't have spectacular special effects nor does it have visually striking sets, but its simplicity is its greatest weapons, because all it needs is the correct characters and you have a winner, the easiest way to make people laugh is turning a serious situation on its head which really shouldn't be funny, but human nature wins out over morals.\r\nIts ironic that a film like this should be so highly praised, but yet probably wouldn't last in todays current climate of happy endings and learnt lessons, we have a very pure and a very real outcome of what the film sets out to do, director and writer Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the most iconic and inspirational filmmakers of all time by turning his hand to a comedy, especially with a subject so fresh at the time of filming. He proves that laughter can be found in the most unlikely of places, especially when we have a very character driven story which throws perspective after perspective, we see a more subdued side when we are in the  of the B52s, yet in the infamous 'War Room' we have much more insanity laced and lighter atmosphere.\r\nDr. Strangelove is a true timeless classic and a fantastic film, it pushed the boundaries of what was funny and what was satire, and came out throwing all the punches, equalling to a dazzling display of excellent performances and some of the funniest moments and quotes to come out of the cinema."

Here's the thing, the movie looks great on a technical level, Peter Sellars and George C. Scott are great in the movie, some of the war scenes looked really amazing, and it's funny at parts. However, I wasn't interested the rest of the characters aside from Sellars multiple performances and Scott's performance. I wasn't that too invested in the story until about halfway through. And there were parts that I simply did not laugh at. The movie, to me, only felt like it was suppose to be a comedy at parts. The rest felt to me that it was suppose to be drama. I guess the structure didn't feel like a true comedy to me. But like I said, the second half is what ultimately drew me into the story. I know lots of people love this political comedy, but personally it didn't work to its full benefit like I hoped it would. Overall, even with its lack in structure, the movie slowly builds to become more engaging the further you get into it even if it feels too late. I'll give \"Dr. Strangelove\" a B-!"

            "review": "East Berlin, November 1984. Five years before its downfall the GDR seeks to maintain its power with the help of a merciless system of control and observation. When Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz puts loyal Stasi-Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler on to the famous writer Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa Maria Sieland who is a famous actress herself, he expects career advancement for himself. For most important politicians are responsible for this \"operative act\".What Wiesler did not expect: the intimate view on the world of the ones he's observing changes the snitch as well. Looking at \"the life of the others\" makes him aware of the beggarliness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude. But the system can't be stopped anymore and a dangerous game, which destroys the love of Christa Maria Sieland and Georg Dreymann and Wieslers present existence begins. Until the fall of the wall each of them has paid a big price. After that a whole new world begins.My personal opinion - though it doesn't count that much - is that this one a an absolute Must See. I can hardly remember such an intelligent and moving German movie especially not including the whole topic of GDR history and the dealing with it. I think this is the first German movie which shows this system as it used to be (which has been confirmed by several contemporary witnesses) and not turns it and its people into comedy though there have been several good ones, of course."

It is a film built on tension and shows you how to create it without those scenes. As such, the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is great, as is the script from him. Both his direction and the writing are top-notch. As with all foreign films, the fact that is in another language can be a barrier of entry for some, but for me, this one felt like it was in English. I barely even noticed they were speaking German I was so engrossed in the story. In addition, the ending is fantastic and really brings everything to a wrap nicely. As a whole, this one is deserving of the praise it has received and stands as one of the best spy films of the past 10 years."

It's 1984 in East Berlin and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi, who investigate people who are suspected of undermining government authority. But his newest subject has an unanticipated effect on the Captain. He sits in an attic day after day, night after night, spying on the people in the flat below.\r\nThe flat is occupied by a playwright named Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his mistress, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesle first saw Dreyman at the opening of one of his plays, where he was informed by a colleague that Dreyman was a successful man.  Dreyman is good-looking, successful, with a beautiful lover; he must be getting away with something. Driven by suspicion, or perhaps by envy, Wiesler has Dreyman's flat wired and begins an official eavesdropping inquiry. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story and, although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption. Wiesler is a fascinating character in that he is a blank slate if you will, trained by his life to reflect no emotion. Sometimes not even his eyes move. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. And he begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier to actual human being is what's most compelling throughout. The seduction depicted in \"The Lives of Others\" is inadvertent. Wiesler is enticed by the possibility of art, meaning, and love, all of which are absent from his existence, but present in that of Dreyman and Crista. Wiesler lives in a bare apartment, with nothing to distinguish it from a hotel room and, when he desires company, he calls a prostitute. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desire to be part of something meaningful leads him to act to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law and place his career in jeopardy. Gripping and arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is masterfully executed. Ulrich Muhe gives a phenomenal performance, a film that will stand the test of time. Oscar winner as Best Foreign Language Film."

In some parts of the movie it can be a little sad or dark, but in the end, it has a very touching message. It shows, through a man named Weisler, that mankind can have good in them as well as bad. He helped Dreyman, an innocent man, escape the punishment of the Stasi. Even though he wound up risking and ruining his career, Weisler still saved Dreyman multiple times without even Dreyman knowing it. That is something that can be hard to grasp because most people are unwilling to help someone to that extent when they themselve lose more than they gain. It actually goes against our normal instinct as human being. As well as being an uplifting an somewhat emotional movie, there are many, many, many deeper psychological aspecs to it.

It somehow depicts a bleak and difficult-to-stomach world with sparks of hope and fun. Of course, a lot of what happens is devastating, too. Apparently, writer-director Labaki amalgamated the story only from real-life events she witnessed first-hand during her research. It certainly shows and, for me, this information makes everything that much more heart-breaking. It's precisely because it's so real that it hurts so much. This emotional connection is only possible because of a fantastically subdued screenplay, some brilliant direction and typically phenomenal performances from all members of the cast. Indeed, the child actors are remarkably good here, ranging in age from pre-teen to barely out-of-the-womb. It's impressive stuff that solidifies the film as one of the most believable in recent years. The whole thing is just effortlessly engaging, wrapping you up in a relatively small story that usually wouldn't get the time of day it deserves. It may be fiction, but it highlights a plethora of issues that truly plague our world every single day. It's all so domestic and, even, mundane, too. It's just a slice of life that we usually don't see. It's great. 8/10"

                    "review": "I wouldn't call it entertaining per se, but it's certainly provocative\n\nTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, Capharna\u00fcm (the word means \"a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects\") is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and \"poverty porn\" at worst. The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki, the film is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Jihad Hojeily and presents a milieu in which people are discardable, children are bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls are married off so their family can pay the rent; babies are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees roam the streets; mental illness goes untreated; people without a Lebanese identity card don't officially exist. The film works because it never feels like it's exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it's notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it's also deeply humanist, with compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core.\n\nTelling the story of Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea), a young boy from the slums who sues his parents for bringing him into the world, the film then flashes back several months, showing Zain running away from home after failing to prevent his parents selling his beloved 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita 'Cedra' Izzam). Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on him, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she's at work, and the trio quickly form a close bond, until one day, Rahil doesn't return home.\n\nUtilising a documentarian style, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain's height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt his subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz's sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It's an aural overload, conveying just how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.\n\nLabaki sets the tone for the film to come in the first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It's subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless here - Sahar is sold for rent money, Rahil is encouraged to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents. This is a world in which people think of children as commodities. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional. Nevertheless, in a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story's moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.\n\nIn terms of problems, the framing device of the trial is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. The scenes in court also come across as more heavily scripted than everything else. Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a didactic plot machination. There is also something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, and on occasion, the film feels like it's going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back the socio-political content.\n\nNever feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, Capharna\u00fcm isn't even especially sentimental. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion And empathy."

                    "review": "In the early chapters of my life, Lebanon was an elusive figure of my imagination. Being born and raised in Toronto, I would hear stories of my homeland from my cousins, uncles and grandmothers. From their descriptions of the countryside, my homeland played in my mind like a fantastic Wild West; the stories always had an underlying sense that the country was a type of Eden, a magical place with magical people, a gem placed perfectly in the midst of chaos.\n\nWhen I made my first trip to the country I was twelve years old. My familial roots trace back to the northern part of the country to a town called Joub Janine in a region known as the Beqaa Valley which is nestled right below the currently devastatingly war-torn Syria. My experiences were life altering; a colossal shift to my consciousness occurred about the world we live in and how that **** spins, how you can enter a world so electric and alien to your own world with just a 12 hour flight by plane.\n\nMy first visit due to age was made up of primarily the country\u2019s decadent cuisine and visits to my family.\n\nI went back at the age of seventeen with my brother for three weeks, and it was then that my Wild West fantasy began to take true form in reality. Streets cross each other making a labyrinth of life, electric lines lay over and under and all around each other, looming above the streets like a friendly spider\u2019s web. The youth is passionate and wild, full of life and wisdom gathered from their surroundings complete with beautiful flowing hair and beautifully wrapped Hijabs rest on the woman as they socialize, smoking tobacco out of hookah pipes that give off the most fragrant of aromas. This aroma follows you, like the sun that stays on your shoulders with strength, or the full flavored tobacco that wafts through the streets and barber shop. The barber shop that is run by a man who\u2019s lost his tongue in the war yet he still knows just what you want from your hand signals. Lebanese like to use their hands when they talk, they throw them down towards the floor like they are letting go of weights and point as if they were being cut from a Tintin comic strip. Firearms are readily available and commonplace yet no one ever shoots each other, they are carried for their destined use of protection, and perhaps the occasional couple of discharges in the many farm fields of the country. Seatbelts are ignored and so are road signs, if any, yet everyone seems to get along just fine. Some ride in German automobiles while some entire families ride on one motorized scooter, newborns and all.\n\nCapernaum, the newest film by Nadine Labaki shows just how exceptionally talented the renowned Lebanese auteur is at capturing that land that holds my heart, and hers as well. Her style is, if comparable, reminiscent of the flavour of Larry Clark\u2019s Kids, with a dash of Paul Greengrass\u2019s Green Zone, and many hints of Vittorio Di Sica\u2019s brilliant Umberto D. The film is poignant; revolving completely around the world of a twelve-year old boy named Zain (Zain Al Rafeea). He lives in a steamy, crammed apartment with his band of siblings, and neglectful mother (Fadi Yousef) and father (Kawsar Al Haddad) in a war-torn neighborhood in Beirut. His parents out of devastating desperation give their daughter to the landlord of their building in hopes of leniency with their payment of rent, an act that naturally enrages Zain, causing him to run away from his family into the abyss of Beirut.\n\nIn his journey of self-preservation destiny he meets an Ethiopian migrant worker Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw). Rahil has an infant child of her own name Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole), who gives such a contribution to the organic documentary inspired style that is truly remarkable. Rahil takes Zain under her care for some time providing some of the most beautifully shot scenes of intimacy in cinema over the past little while. The film\u2019s heart is transcended through Zain and Yonas; their acting is so poetic, watching these two children interact, with the slightest of movements, give elusive kinetic energy that never feels premeditated in the slightest.\n\nDrama ultimately knocks on the films door and heartbreak occurs with Zain climatically commits a violent act causing him to stand in court with his parents. He declares hatred for his parents and seeks justice for them giving him life when they have no intention to properly love or care for him, as well as his siblings. This embodies the idea of Capernaum which is according to Libaki \u201cto give a voice to children who otherwise do not have one.\u201d\n\nI have watched a select couple of brief scenes from Labaki\u2019s previous films, yet never have I seen one in its entirety and this was quite the film to start me off. The opening sequence is melodious; we see Zain with a number of other children, horse playing through the tangles of flights of stairs and street corners of the neighbourhood."

But what we see for two hours is the incredible story of a selfless, courageous, and incredibly energetic child who does what his parents neglect to do \u2013 he takes care of a younger child and the child\u2019s mother, going to great lengths to feed the younger boy and keep him safe, eventually saving the baby\u2019s mother and putting the adults in the story to shame. The boundless energy and single-mindedness of Zain are in stark contrast to his lazy and disinterested parents. It\u2019s an incredible and exhausting story, full of the boy\u2019s energy, courage, and goodness in a dark, chaotic world."

It genuinely cares for its characters especially the wonderful Zain Al Rafeea who gives one of the best performances on screen this year. Despite being heartbreaking, the movie manages to give us some funny moments that highlight the sense of humor Lebanese people have. It also manages to give us a glimmer of hope at the end without leaving behind the devastating reality of its subject matter."

Nothing could have been further from the truth. He told me that seamen, even those on opposite sides, share something unique. He told me that his ship picked up some U Boat survivors from a ramming. They were just ordinary men doing the bidding of their masters, just like he was. They were put down at Scapa Flow as POW's after being at sea for 5 weeks. Many of them had formed friendships with the Royal Navy men, including my father. He formed a friendship with a submariner called Gotz Stiffel and they remained friends until Gotz passed away. My father attended his funeral in Duisburg and he was welcomed as an old friend by the survivors of that U Boat sinking. My father said that film bought tears to his eyes. They were just ordinary men caught up in extraordinary times and this film captured everything from fear to boredom and relief. He said, and I utterly agreed with him this was just about the finest anti-war film ever made."

As the film is German, not surprisingly, is a German submarine. And tastes good to hear the dialogues in the original tongue, giving more authenticity tho the movie than the English, which most of films used indiscriminately, because of commercial interests.\n\nThis film is, of all submarine movies, the best I've ever seen. The more realistic and closer to reality, without dramatic contrivances, without the flying imagination of those who have never seen a submarine but has to make a film about it. Its based on a book by Lothar G. Buchheim which, I believe, describes real events. The script reflected this effort, this search for reality. I do not know any of the actors, I am no expert in cinema, but I enjoyed the interpretation of J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, the captain, and Klaus Wennemann, who played chief engineer submarine. I will not be very surprised if someone says to me that some footage was shot in a real submarine... whole scenario was thought to detail and it shows how submarines are claustrophobic.\n\nFar from the American sensationalism, this European film makes a very interesting picture of a reality that most movies rather fantasize the extreme. It is a proof of how thin can sometimes be the line between documentary and a cinematographic work."

Un vrai r\u00f4le de composition jusqu'\u00e0 la fin, une fin qui offre au film un d\u00e9nouement \u00e9tonnant de maturit\u00e9... et d'ironie.\n\nCar Das Boot n'est pas que dramatique et stressant, il est aussi parfois dr\u00f4le et toujours tr\u00e8s humain, plus vrai que nature et r\u00e9aliste jusqu'au bout des boulons. Bien s\u00fbr, les effets ont un peu vieilli pour une certaine partie d'entre eux (les maquettes...) mais au vu de son \u00e2ge, Das Boot fait encore le boulot. On s'interroge \u00e9galement sur la musique \u00e9lectronique de Klaus Doldinger mais on finit par y adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 notre insu, son th\u00e8me enquiquinant se montrant tr\u00e8s efficace.\n\nIl s'agit clairement d'un beau film de guerre dont la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 est touchante, sans aucune gloriole de bas \u00e9tage, sans guimauve d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, sans effets de manches ou autre tour de passe-passe : c'est prenant, surprenant et d'un pacifisme intelligent."

The claustrophobia of this film is something really special. We sit in half- darkness most of the time anticipating hull sounds. The story is simple, though it`s just secondary to the main part and that is the Uboat. This tin coffin reminds us of everything we`d like never to experience in our lives. And yet there were real poeple volunteering to serve onboard of those coffins. Right to the end that history showed most of them were destroyed in action. For some reason the German actors really play it well. I mean this couldn`t have been done so good if they were average. Everything is believable here - the effects (as few of them as there are) are great, the submarine external views underwater are outright scary, the music perfectly goes with the atmosphere."

            "review": "Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite \"Salome\" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for \"Born Yesterday\" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.\"I am big--it's the pictures that got small\". \"All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup\"."

Brilliant directed, paced, written, and some great acting from William Holden and Gloria Swanson, come together to form one of the most well-known and popular film noirs of all-time. Riveting throughout, this one tells the story of Hollywood gone wrong and really all comes together well. The narration and identity of the narrator were both great, great touches that really worked wonders for the film. The characters are all well-written and, oddly, sympathetic. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a really cool film that I cannot recommend enough. Though it may not be my favorite film ever obviously, it is still really, really good and you can easily see why it has gotten the praise it has over the years."

            "review": "I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the \"real\" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the \"monsters within\" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies."

Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion!\n\nWinston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind. And you know what, he is right. For one thing, Paths of Glory is gorgeously filmed, with relentlessly beautiful cinematography and nice costumes and scenery. The screenplay is sometimes humorous, sometimes moving and sometimes even haunting, either way it was some fine writing. The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof **** man at work.\n\nThe performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as \"the arrogant aristocrat\" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Aqui o diretor direciona todo aquele cen\u00e1rio a uma critica a guerra de forma geral, mas focando na falta de humanidade que a politica do exercito tem em pratica.\nO diretor nos guia apresentando um contraste entre Col. Dax e Gen. Paul Mireau. \u00c9 claro que Mireau \u00e9 apenas uma reflex\u00e3o de todo politica militar baseada na hierarquia criada pelos mesmos.\n\nA atmosfera de medo criada aqui, principalmente nos momentos antecedentes ao ataque, \u00e9 quase palp\u00e1vel de t\u00e3o presente. Sentimos medo por eles mesmo sem conhec\u00ea-los. O ataque \u00e9 cruel e mostra uma pintura quase real do que de fato \u00e9 a guerra, longe de todos aquele retratos de hero\u00edsmo/patriotismo criados por puro marketing e vaidade pr\u00f3pria. Os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o excelentes, fazendo-nos refletir sobre diversas vis\u00f5es cujo n\u00e3o tive contato antes. Aquele relacionado ao medo de morrer ou de ser ferido remete muito a mim, pra ser sincero. O discuso do Col. Dax no julgamento emociona, mas n\u00e3o de uma forma satisfat\u00f3ria, pois o que estamos a ver \u00e9 um retrato injusto e contradit\u00f3rio por parte de toda institui\u00e7\u00e3o do exercito. Toda a cena, de forma geral, \u00e9 magistralmente bem dirigida. Senti uma raiva descomunal pelo fato de que dialogar naquele per\u00edodo era uma baralha perdida, afinal, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 o que fazer quando se est\u00e1 cercado de alienados - parece que a coisa n\u00e3o mudou muito no seculo seguinte...\n\nNo aspecto t\u00e9cnico, o filme \u00e9 igualmente impec\u00e1vel. Os efeitos pr\u00e1ticos tornam toda cena demasiadamente realista, junto ao efeitos sonoros. A fotografia trabalha muito bem com a luz, e tem um controle muito grande da cena em planos abertos.

A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he's just out of hospital - he wasn't dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor's orders he's not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he's not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance! How marvelous that what amounts to a bit of Agatha Christie's usual fare becomes such an entertaining and at times right down riveting piece of film-making."

I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something \"Nolanesque\" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."

I have seen this film in my country's theater, BHD at Vincom Plaza Le Van Viet, Vietnam; and I watched through all three hours with no missing details.\n\nAs a biographical thriller drama film, ''Oppenheimer'' is focused on the father of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer. While focused on his contribution to the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project, the film also depicted his later life with his dramatic and tragic fall in 1954. Using color motion and black-and-white motion to tell the story through the film, I think this is Nolan's high-handed risk. But that doesn't make the plot and content of the movie any less interesting, it also increases the psychological drama moments for viewers. Nolan's screenplay and direction are ultra-brilliant, and I gave the plot and content 9/10.\n\nFor the performances, the A-list Hollywood stars have brought to me and the world's audiences their super-excellent performance. Included here is Cillian Murphy, the Irish actor best known for his role as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. Throughout the film, his eyes, emotions, outfits, and charisma are perfect, and his psychological depth helps him completely immerse himself in this role. Others in the cast have done so well in the film, including \"Iron Man\" Robert Downey Jr. when he played Lewis Strauss, the arrogant businessman who wants to kick Oppenheimer out of the political issues. And the fact Downey and Murphy have won the Oscars has proven that they are worthy of what they represent in the film. I would give the score for acting 9/10.\n\nOther contributions, including Hoyte van Hoytema's excellent cinematography technique, Ludwig Goransson's brilliant score, and some stunning no-CGI visuals, further enhanced the artistic perfection of the film. 10/10 is the score I would give for the film's other contributions.\n\nHaving won 7 Oscars at the 2024 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, was a worthy achievement for the film crew, especially Nolan, who has now just won the first two Oscars in his career. Overall, ''Oppenheimer'' is a must-see film for all viewers with everything it has shown."

In a world in which we increasingly turn our backs on the fundamental questions and reflections that terrify us most, Oppenheimer forces us to face all this and guides us on a journey into the turmoil of a character whose anguish in the end becomes the same of the spectator. The overwhelming technical perfection is just the tip of the iceberg of this monumental work, which has the merit of not only being one of the very few examples of impeccability in the history of cinema but above all a warning for humanity in the years to come."

A great cast (Cillian Murphy is incredible), along with top notch directing and writing add up to what is undeniably a powerful piece of cinema.

The production is brilliant, the cast is impeccable, and the direction is formidable.\n\nThe film begins by focusing on the creation of the first atomic bomb, and the tension of the race against time is palpable. Even knowing the outcome, it is impossible not to feel nervous watching the scientists work tirelessly to develop the weapon.\n\nWhen the bomb is finally created, tested, and used, there is a sense that the film will lose its meaning. However, the director manages to keep our interest by exploring the consequences of the bomb for Oppenheimer.\n\nUnderstandably, some people may have felt that the film should have shown the consequences of the explosion in Japan. For the sake of awareness, it would be essential to have seen the horrors of nuclear war. However, the film is about Oppenheimer, not Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Therefore, the director's side is also understandable.\n\nThe drama of the scientist's life is portrayed very well. The troubled life ****, the troubled relationships, the difficulties and fears of creating the bomb, the relationship with friends and colleagues, the relationship with the government, and finally, the depression and trauma of being the creator of something so terrible in the history of humanity.\n\nThe film's artistic direction is impeccable, both sonically and visually. The soundtrack is epic and helps to create an atmosphere of tension and suspense. The cinematography is beautiful and captures the beauty and horror of creating an atomic weapon.\n\nThe cast is excellent, with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt standing out. Murphy plays Oppenheimer with mastery, capturing his genius, his complexity, and his torment. Downey Jr. and Blunt are also incredible and bring to life important characters in the scientist's life.\n\nOverall, Oppenheimer is a must-see film. It is a complex and challenging work but also a work of art that deserves to be seen."

Oppenheimer keeps the whole movie in suspense, not being a thriller. Great cast, amazing work of the operators. Oppenheimer takes 3 hours, but you watch the movie without stopping. This is the best work of Cillian Murphy, this is the best film biography that American cinema shot, this is one of the most unusual ways to tell the biography of a person in the film leading 3 parallel storylines. Oppenheimer is clearly not a movie for everyone and many will just find it boring. There's no action here, and most of the movie is dialogue. Also, the culmination of the film here is not the very fact of the creation of nuclear weapons by Openheimer, which was clearly expected by most viewers. But thanks to Nolan that there are also directors who are able to shoot at this level not for a wide range of viewers. I can't imagine how Oppenheimer can be compared to Barbie."

The constant back and forth between different parts of Oppenheimer's life assembles a dense narrative that unravels his moral dilemma or guilty conscious. \nThe movie is mostly from Oppenheimer's subjective perspective and another novelty of the movie is how this subjective reality is, subtly, constructed.\nA must-watch and as always on the biggest screen possible."

Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the creation of the atomic bomb. Nolan's cinematic expertise is on full display as he navigates through Oppenheimer's journey, skillfully blending historical accuracy with artistic interpretation.Casting Cillian Murphy in the titular role was a stroke of genius. Murphy embodies Oppenheimer's intellect and internal conflicts with remarkable depth, delivering a performance that is both captivating and emotionally charged. Supported by a stellar ensemble cast, including Emily Blunt and Michael Caine, the film excels in its portrayal of the interpersonal dynamics within the scientific community amidst the pressures of wartime.Nolan's direction elevates the storytelling, employing his signature nonlinear narrative style to unravel Oppenheimer's life, from his groundbreaking scientific discoveries to the moral quandaries he faced in the wake of his creation's catastrophic implications. The cinematography is stunning, seamlessly transitioning between the grandeur of scientific breakthroughs and the intimate struggles of the protagonist.While the film provides a compelling exploration of Oppenheimer's psyche and the moral dilemmas of scientific innovation, at times, the pacing feels slightly uneven, causing a brief detachment from the narrative flow.Overall, \"Oppenheimer\" is a thought-provoking cinematic experience that prompts reflection on the ethical responsibilities of scientific advancement. Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess, coupled with outstanding performances, earns this film an 8 out of 10. It's a must-watch for those fascinated by historical dramas and the human complexities behind pivotal moments in history."

I never thought it possible that the story of this man, who gave the world its means of cataclysmic destruction, could be boring for such long stretches. \n\nExplosive scenes meant to show us the inside of Oppenheimer's mind simply didn't. And fancy cuts between time periods didn't make up for what amounts to a lack of substance and depth in the writing, especially the character work. We simply don't care enough, about Oppenheimer or secondary characters that, with the exception of Downey's, we can barely tell apart, i.e., the talking heads. Considering the subject, and this rich opportunity, that's a tragedy in itself. I know this director is worshiped for his cleverness with form, but I think he was the wrong choice for this material. What went on in the mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer as he developed the atomic bomb and later saw it instantly kill tens of thousands Japanese civilians? I know far less about his inner turmoil than I do about the political firestorm he set off. How is that possible?"

I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.\n\nI especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.\n\nI was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.\n\nI have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.\n\nOverall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Kaufman shows to be one of the finest directors and screenplayer of his generation for this tear jerker romantic comedy that will make you laugh at a moment and cry one moment later with also stunning performances by both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet at their best here. One of the greatest movies of XXI century without a doubt."

The weird effects on Patrick in the dark dream sequence looked very awkward. The baby Joel and Clementine were pretty stupid looking in the first scene, yet also funny. The scenes that came after were really playful and funny. The scene where the books were slowly whiting out, was a very well done and interesting effect. It was cool how as the memories strayed from their original paths, they held elements in common with others, both prior and unrealized. Unfortunately, I cannot appreciate this film to its fullest, since I am young, and thus I have much to learn, and much to lose. Despite this, I can recognize truly stellar performances by both Carry and Winslet. I less so enjoyed Ruffalo and Dunst, although, they were still well cast. The film handled many interesting concepts very well, while also portraying a world wherein people can run away from any problem. The way that this movie handled its circular narrative was quite unique since the time in between the start and the end is not necessarily definite. I don't think that I can stress enough how this movie handles what it shows and how it shows it. It seems as if everything shown has a purpose, and is then later drawn upon again. See this movie if you enjoy conceptual pieces, or are a fan of romance."

The acting is very good, especially by Jim Carrey standards but I think that Clementine, Kate Winslet character is played over the top. My biggest problem with this movie is the pacing and the order that the script is played, the scenes where the main protagonists are together are very good but when it comes to the secondary characters they don`t feel as important to the plot. They feel like exposition characters just to set the plot in motion. I feel that the soundtrack is also lacking especially not a single licensed track is memorable and in a romance movie that is a really important part of your movie. Overall this isn`t a BAD movie perse but, I think that this movie lacks in the areas that romance movies should really work, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do have chemistry but a convoluted narrative ruined the movie for me."

In this film, he tries to forget a failed romance with the irreverent Clementine (Kate Winslet) through a procedure that is, in practice, a brainwashing. But he regrets that with the process ongoing and tries to find a way to keep his memories. The film seems quite original and, in fact, the script has merit for trying to create a romantic comedy on a premise so different from the normal, but a large part of the plot is highly predictable. Another problem was the dialogues. In a film so light and so romance-oriented why insist on profanity or heavy slang? Some special effects look good, in particular the fading things and the passages from one memory to another at random, allowing us to have a wider knowledge of Joel's past. The soundtrack is quite kitsch and match the taste of both main characters but displeases the ears of the audience. Carrey was perfect in the main character, maintaining a good chemistry with Winslet, who also didn't disappoint. The rest of the cast (where we can see Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst or Tom Wilkinson) do their job satisfactorily, but leaving room for the main actors to shine."

The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.This one is a keeper in my movie library."

The director was Gus Van Sant (Drugstore **** movie tells a story about a irish-descendant boy in Boston that works as janitor in a mathematics faculty, and it is a self-taught genius, with a troubled past and present - some  mathematical riddles are left by the head of the chair in the faculty (Skarsg\u00e5rd) and mysteriously solved by night. Catching up with Matt Damon character Will he can be out of parole if he gets a job and consult with a psychiatrist what shows to be a tid bit tough thing. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget, and received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. Nothing bad, at all for someone being just out of Harvard University. Anther curiosity: character Skylar in the movie have the same name and background of Matt Damon's girlfriend back then.Robin Williams acts as the psychiatrist that could connect with this troubled boy, in a solid role - speaking of solid role it was nice to see Matt Damon out of some action movie in really nice drama scenes. Another actor that shows up is Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, yes the father of the four sons the most known being Bill (of \"It\"). Nice heartwarming moving movie thought the end with a solid script. I would scorre it a 8.0 out of 10.0 / B+. It is strange that I didn't even reminded this one back in 97, but then I remembered that that year I was in the 3rd year of Medicine so not much time to seeing movies I guess."

The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.\n\nThe acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best \"drama\" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.\n\nAll in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The movie's got such an amazing story and it's about this lad who's called Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who's this very intelligent genius at mathematics and he's really good at solving all the difficult mathematical problems.\n\nHowever, when he starts to face an emotional crisis, he starts to see many different psychiatrist's until he finds the right one who can help him and his name is Dr Sean Maguireto (Robin Williams), who later helps Will recover.\n\nThe movie's got some amazing performance's from all of the cast, especially from Will (Matt Damon) and Sean (Robin Williams), those two are honestly brilliant and the two of them bring their characters to life so well.\n\nThe dialogue which is given and received from each character throughout this movie is all very strong dialogue. The dialogue which this movie's got never feels weak at any moment and every single bit of the dialogue comes out very strong.\n\nThe movie's cinematographer Jean-Yves Esoffier does such a beautiful job on capturing each moment and each emotion from each character so beautifully, he honestly does it so well.\n\nAlso, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams throughout this movie is honestly great and it adds so much to their friendship in this movie and it works perfectly.\n\nThe pacing in this movie is honestly great, each main moment which ends up happening throughout this movie is all well built up and it's so beautifully well done.\n\nThe movie's even got some brilliant humour, which is well scattered throughout and all of the humour works very well in making me laugh in some sort of way.\n\nFinally, the movie's got some really great emotions and they're all well built up with the great pacing and it really adds to their characters as a whole throughout this movie.\n\nThe movie's even got some brilliant character development with the main character Will, It's so beautifully well done and it works so perfectly due to the events, which end up happening to him.\n\nThe love interest in this movie, which is between Will and Skylar (Minnie Driver) is so beautifully well done and the certain events, which end up happening throughout their relationship are all well built up.\n\nOverall, Good Will Hunting is such a brilliant movie with such an amazing story, amazing performances, very strong dialogue, beautiful cinematography, great chemistry, great pacing, brilliant humour, great emotions, brilliant character development and such a beautiful love interest.\n\nI'd honestly recommend Good Will Hunting, if you're wanting to watch a very beautiful Drama/Romance movie.

This vivacious film runs on nothing but the merit of the script. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the writers, aren't bringing anything new on the table, but it is the Disney of the dramatic movies. Incredibly confident in its ingredients, the film never stutters, not even for a frame. What's been so crowd pleasing about the script, is its ability to create a topsy-turvy world in a pragmatic one. Usually, the concept of \"power\" in the hand is often presented as misused by the characters and also always is craved by them.\n\nIn here, Matt Damon who powerfully portrays a guy that accounts in, his photographic memory as a hindrance. His surrounding doesn't ask him to repel it, but his affection towards that very surrounding and the fear to go physically distant with it, makes him turn all this into a hobby. Damon's excruciating performance of an arrogant and blessed kid has a match that makes him rubble in a snap.\n\nAnd the answer is Robin Williams, that cloaks in a completely opposite persona to Damon in order to get in, in his game. If Damon likes to hurt, he keeps his wound open, if Damon oozes power and rage, he whispers warmth so gently that it makes your eyes teary within a blink. And despite of all the other tracks sprinkled amazingly in the film, Williams and Damon sharing a few laughs sitting in the room is the best asset of it, that Gus Van Sant is well aware of and encourages it like some big antic to stand tall and proud upon. Good Will Hunting is never a hunt, if anything it is the surrender in a long lasting lost game, that actually our host never cares for."

I wish that this whole film's plot could've just solely been about these two, but disappointingly, the screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck is too incompetent (it's a good thing they stuck to acting I suppose). In between the thought-provoking scenes involving Damon and Williams is a clich\u00e9-ridden story told with characters that are not engaging nor have enough backstory for us, the audience, to care about. All I need to say is that it is a romance plot with the titular character and a girl and there's a misunderstood fight between them ****....yeah. It's that same old 'song and dance' we all achingly know. In fact, the effect the film had on me was a tug-of-war, pulling me back and forth between smart characters with smart dialogue and dumb characters with dumb dialogue. I'm teetering on the fence for \"Good Will Hunting\". I want to like this film, but I just can't stomach its amateur plot peppered with intelligent scenes. It (sadly) comes across as Hollywood trying to relate with the smart crowd and failing, which in turn, makes for a phony film."

It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a \"comedy-drama\", I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10"

The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.\n\nWhat I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The film provides a satire about the middle class's perception of love and beauty, while delving deeper into the themes of love, sexuality, materialism and liberation and providing a character study about a man slowly delving deeper into his fantasies. Kevin Spacey does a great job in portraying Lester Burnham and he genuinely comes off as creepy. The cinematography is wonderful and Thomas Newman's score is phenomenal and compliments the story well. The biggest issue I have with the film is that the sex scenes are uncomfortable to watch and its depiction of sex comes off as disturbing and off putting. I never cared too much about the characters other than Lester and the film drags down during the second act. American Beauty can be a film that is hard to watch at times, but it does a great job in tackling its subject and it makes for a memorable watch."

The characters are perfectly presented and linked to each other, which allows us to feel a certain empathy for each of them.\n\nOriginally released in 1999 'American Beauty' still shines by the topicality of the subjects it deals with. If it could have been called 'Beauty' only because it presents how human can evolve and elevate through time, it also has the decency and the presence of mind of adding the adjective 'American' to clearly insert itself in a socio-cultural tendency. The story shows multiple characters living in the 21st century in America with all its madness, its purity and fantasies. They all have to take a stand in order to be someone else rather than a poor stereotype or clich\u00e9. If in appearance people may seem almost normal we can always choose to live our lives in the way we want to. And when we choose to (re)take control of it the people around us may notice it. And react to it.\n\nSome of the artistic choices may seem incomprehensible, such as the presence of rose petals here and there, which may give the impression that \"American Beauty\" is superficial or poorly thought out, but I think it brings a kind of lightness to the plot. I found myself disappointed by the end but I think it is the point: you can make effort to live closer than what you want but in the end reality always strikes back."

My only guess is Kevin Spacey looking at Mena Suvari in a cheerleading outfit because nothing much else makes sense. Anyway Kevin Spacey who plays Lester Burnham has a daughter played by the beautiful Thora Birch and he kind of ends up having a thing for her friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) which is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. The film is full of bits of nudity, perversion, sex scenes, Mena Suvari in a bath of red roses and Kevin Spacey being a jerk and creepy and sometimes funny but also drugs are involved. Great film in everyway from the great acting down to the beautifully shot red roses scenes and blah de blah. Mena Suvari is very beautiful and gives a good performance, Annette Benning is a bit boring but she doesn't ruin the film and Wes Bentley films Thora Birch from his window and Wes Bentley plays some weird next door neighbour with a **** dad who is convinced his son is having some **** relationship with Lester (Kevin Spacey) next door but he's not all there if you catch my drift. Some weird moments but beautifully executed film and a great movie."

What begins almost as a Comedy, full of laughable moment and, to be quite honest, some equally laughable dialogue slowly devolves into a tragedy in which the themes that Mendes is going for become apparent.\n\nKevin Spacey's character is the best acted of the film. Any scene he is in has him stealing the show. That being said the acting all around in this film is fantastic. Each character is written in such a way that aspects of them are likeable, but they all have tragic flaws. Perhaps they are angry at the world for existing, feel isolated by the families, or feel that the world revolves around them. The plot in general revolves around these flaws as they are exposed and concludes with all of the different threads converging together. The twists of that convergence is what truly makes this film remarkable.\n\nThe cinematography in American Beauty is also superb with some of the best that I have ever seen in a motion picture. The manner in which several scenes are shot (but especially one scene in particular) help contribute to essential themes that Mendes is trying to show.\n\nOverall, American Beauty is a very unique film that I found to be through provoking throughout. The slow start that has one scene I found to be more cringy than either comedic or tragic is made up for the rest of the film, which is nothing short of a unique masterpiece."

It's an enviable record for a movie that, when we look at it, doesn't seem to justify it ... In fact, just looking at the Oscar nominees for Best Movie in that far 2000s, I liked \"The Insider\" or \"a lot more\" The Green Mile \"than this movie, which basically portrays the unfulfilled fantasies of a middle-aged, suburban middle-class man when\n\nIn fact, the American middle class is portrayed here in an almost dystopian way: a social group wrapped in huge paranoia about appearances and \"looking good,\" obsessed with politically correct and socially acceptable, trying to keep secrets, taboos, prejudices and imperfections hidden through a beautiful house, a spotless lawn, a new car, a good tie. The patriarch of the family lives a crisis of middle age through the nostalgia of past and underused youth, to the point of feeling a sudden sexual attraction for a teenager. His wife, in turn, is the archetype of frivolity and emptiness, living a marriage of appearances and discounting everything through an extramarital affair. The daughter of this dysfunctional couple is the typical young rebel ... until she decides to plot with her boyfriend to kill her own father. And there is much more throughout the movie. Cartoon characters in a dystopian and uncomfortable portrait, especially for those who identify with the US suburban middle class (not my case at all).\n\nKevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Thora Birch are the central trio of actors who bring life to a family that is beyond normal. Nevertheless, the three had excellent performances and in fact deserved to be awarded and recognized for that. Mena Suvari also looked good to me as the provocative nymphet. Sam Mendes ensured careful, bold and inspired driving. Having been the first film in which he participated as a director, it was certainly a milestone in his career and secured a future for him.\n\nProvocative, bold, disturbing, is a movie where taboos are put in check and troublesome truths are exposed. It is not at all a family movie or to see with children and young people nearby."

People liked talking about it and recommending it to those who haven't seen it. I'm sure for the fact I've seen it and you know what? I love it to death. It's one of those movies that you have to watch before you die. It is one of my favourite films of all time. Kevin Spacey has done it again with his excellent performance like in The Usual Suspects. he won an Oscar for his performance as Lester Burnham and now he's a two time Oscar winner. Everyone else did a fantastic job acting in this film including Annette Bening. The story in this is great and flawless about Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham narrating about his life. He has a wife, Carolyn Burnham played by Annette Bening who is an ambitious woman and a daughter, Jane played by Thora Birch who f**king despises her family. Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts who is obsessively filming everything around his surroundings with his camcorder and he is curious about Lester's daughter, Jane next door. Lester hates his job, has a midlife crisis and becomes possessed with his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes played by Mena Suvari. He starts having sexual fantasies about her, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. As much as I love everything about American Beauty, this is something that I watch almost every night. It has that amazing impeccable cinematography that just makes the way the film looks satisfying like the red petals that Mena Suvari is laying on. That is the moment of beauty. \"Spec-tacular!\" The directing is really good. It's made by Sam Mendes who I assume who directs two James Bond movies like Skyfall and Spectre starring Daniel Craig. I was shocked by the fact that this was actually his first film which is quite a coincidance! I really, really love this film. It shows the characters how they're feeling and communicate with one another. Whenever you're think of American Beauty, you would be like, \"Wow! That is the most beautiful film I've seen!\" and it is a beautiful film with surprisingly dark humour, the acting is perfection, the story is well written, the cinematography is impeccably shot and it's definitely worth your five Oscars if you haven't seen it. This is one of Sam Mendes' incredible Oscar winning masterpieces! You have no idea what you're missing, I'm sure. But don't worry... you won't someday."

Thora Birch.\nDirected by Sam Mendes.\nBy Blake Patterson.\n100/100.   \u201cTrue realism consists in revealing the surprising things which habit keeps covered and prevents us from seeing,\u201d said Jean Cocteau, a French writer. American Beauty, released in 1999, is a motion picture that can fool the public, if they just read the title. They would probably think that it is an idealistic movie about the beauty of America. Just to let the readers know, American Beauty is the complete opposite of romanticism. This film is a piece of realism that doesn't play safe. American Beauty is one of those rare all-time classics that radiates with an original plot, a first-rate cast, wicked provocation, and a fantastic crew; this critique will also include a personal experience.   As a consequence of pushing the envelope, American Beauty is a film doesn't play safe for its viewers. Alan Ball, the screenwriter of American Beauty, writes this film with such savage wit that it is so irresistible to watch. American Beauty is a morbid look into the lives of two dysfunctional families who are neighbors. People like to say that this film is about a sexually frustrated father who is obsessed with his daughter's sleazy friend. That is a subplot in this film, but that is not its focus. Professors are probably teaching this film to future screenwriters or anyone in the study of film. That's one of the reasons why American Beauty has such a fresh screenplay.   By the same token, American Beauty has an exceptional ensemble. Kevin Spacey portrays as the most blunt character, Lester Burnham, in the whole film, and he defines pure perfection in the role. Annette Bening is outstanding as Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife. The young cast members, who are played by Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, deliver awesome performances in the film. Viewers will witness other superb performances from Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, etc. A masterpiece always includes a marvelous cast.   In addition to the following, American Beauty is one of the most provocative films ever made. One of the best parts of this film is how it conveys these characters with optimism, like I Love Lucy and other sitcoms, from the introduction. As the story furthers, it goes more in depth with these characters; this is a fine example of realism. People who want movies that show happiness should turn off the movie. Another reason why this film will trigger people is due to the eroticism displayed in this film; this will irritate prudish people. The other common reason why American Beauty is controversial is because of the mature themes it contains; the public will have to look closer, watch American Beauty, to discover what the subjects are. These are the common reasons why American Beauty causes attention.   In the meantime, I would like to discuss a personal experience that revolves around this film. Last year in Theater Arts 1, I chose to perform the introductory monologue from this film; by the way, the monologues in this film are well-written. I told my teacher about my choice for the project, and he was already supporting me. If I had told the other teacher in the auditorium about it, I wouldn't have been able to act it out due to one sexual reference. That shows how people are about content in movies these days.   As a result of brilliance, American Beauty includes ravishing work from the crew members. Audiences will experience gorgeous cinematography from Conrad L. Hall. They will also hear Thomas Newman's dazzling film score. American Beauty was Sam Mendes' debut as a director, and the stakes were high because of that. Mendes is an artist, and he knows how direct with enthusiasm. Kudos to the crew members for creating this film phenomenally.   In conclusion, American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever made. The film is flat-out uproarious, and then it gives audiences a compelling punch in the face. American Beauty won five Academy Awards including: Kevin Spacey for Best Leading Actor, Alan Ball for Best Original Screenplay, Sam Mendes for Best Director, Conrad L. Hall for Best Cinematography, and Best Picture. American Beauty is not only one of the best films of the nineties, but it is also one of the best movies of the twentieth century. Like Cocteau said in his quote above, American Beauty exhibits the surprises hidden in these humane characters, and it doesn't keep their secrets covered."

Of course, the enigmatic and darkly beautiful nature of the film is helped along by subtle, honest and terrific performances from Spacey and Bening, a mesmerising score and stunning direction, but underpinning this all is a witty, dark, optimistic, pessimistic, original and overwhelming screenplay that gives this film too many dimensions to wave matching gardening clogs at."

                    "review": "An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, \"American Beauty\" is a real American original.\r\n\r\nThe landscape of Ball\u2019s story is the familiar one of small-town America, and the initial take on the subject is the equally familiar one of houses with white picket fences and perfectly manicured gardens providing deceptive facades for lives wracked by hostility, tension, noncommunication and perversity. Fortunately, this view is intended not as a revelation but as a given, a starting point for a subtle and acutely judged tale in which nearly every important character metamorphoses in an utterly unpredictable way.\r\n\r\nCalmly observant narration by Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) informs at the outset that, in less than a year from the start of the story, he\u2019ll be dead. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d he quips as he and his family are trotted out. Lester is a self-described loser, having lost interest in his job at an advertising magazine as well as in any meaningful relationship with his beautiful, high-strung, real estate agent wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and sullen high school-age daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Family life is a sham for all of them, and they deal with it in different ways: Lester admits it, Carolyn refuses to face it, and Jane is just waiting it out until she can fly the coop.\r\n\r\nThreatened with dismissal from his job, hangdog Lester finds things begin changing for him when he becomes smitten by Jane\u2019s best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), a blond Lolita with sex on the brain. Exhilarated by the ludicrous prospect of seducing her, Lester begins obsessively pumping iron and fuels his youthful state of mind by smoking dope with a strange young man, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), who has just moved into the house next door with his father (Chris Cooper), a recently retired Marine Corps colonel, and shut-down mother (Allison Janney).\r\n\r\nRicky frequently takes surreptitious video footage of Jane, and when she calls him on it, an unlikely but oddly convincing romantic friendship begins blossoming that finally gives Jane a release for her emotional frustration. Carolyn, for her part, seeks an outlet in the most conventional manner, lurching into a motel-room affair with the debonair \u201cking\u201d of local real estate, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). Evidently the only well-adjusted and relatively happy people in the neighborhood are \u201cJim and Jim\u201d (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards), a **** couple with whom Lester takes up jogging.\r\n\r\nOne of the film\u2019s constant sources of delight and surprise is the way characters both hide and reveal their private interests, and how they are often perceived and misjudged by others. It is not giving away too much or going too far into the story\u2019s many mysteries to say that Lester can approach serenity and even a state of grace despite his initial wormlike status; that Ricky confidently pursues a secret life in spite of close surveillance from his martinet father, who forces his son to submit to regular urine tests for drug use; that Carolyn\u2019s materialist preoccupation has, in fact, become her substance, and that Jane\u2019s amorphous personality is susceptible to being shaped in just about any direction by the first strong personality she meets.\r\n\r\nConsistently provocative and devilishly amusing through the first hour, pic clicks into high gear midway when Lester and Carolyn finally have it out. They don\u2019t declare war, exactly, but Lester decides to let down any pretense to responsibility or normalcy in order to do his own thing as he did when he was 20, carefree and full of expectation. Blackmailing his boss for a big severance package, he hilariously takes a gig at the job at which he was always happiest, flipping burgers at a fast-food restaurant, buys his dream car and openly smokes weed whenever he wants. His new freewheeling approach to life makes him giddy, so much so that he believes he and his wife can revive their long-buried sexual relationship. But Carolyn and Jane are appalled at his breezy, tell-it-like-it-is attitude, fomenting a mood of anxious melodrama leading to the event promised by the opening narration.\r\n\r\nMendes, the hottest young British theater director of recent years, on the basis of \u201cCabaret\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d displays a very sure hand in his first film. As precise and controlled in its effects as his legit work, \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d is stylized in its images and humor, and Mendes has been exceedingly fortunate in working with a cinematographer as skillful as vet Conrad L. Hall, who is unsurpassed in his ability to augment the meaning of the material he films by finding its perfect visual correlative.\r\n\r\nNaomi Shohan\u2019s production design and Julie Weiss\u2019 costumes enhance the film\u2019s look of designed reality, while Thomas Newman\u2019s score and the many adroitly chosen song snippets often create ironic counterpoint to the exceptionally tart and entertaining proceedings."

                    "review": "Over the years, many films have taken a dark look at the supposedly perfect ideal of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear family. For many, the suburban life is the American dream. For others, however, it can turn into a twisted nightmare of unfulfilled desires, repressed needs, and **** hopes. Because of the necessity to keep up appearances, a serene facade often conceals a breeding ground for dysfunction, anxiety, and hypocrisy. Directors like David Lynch have made this their playground. Lynch in particular delights in depicting the root causes of social decay in suburbia - and he does it by autopsy. American Beauty is not as dark as a Lynch project, since it allows for small moments of redemption, but it mines the same general territory.\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty is about the ways in which these characters grow, and the catalysts that break them out of their near-catatonic existences. It's also about the emotional paralysis that comes with age and security. We take refuge in routine, and, after a number of years, the thought of change becomes terrifying. Happiness, the goal of youth, is replaced by the desire for the artificial comfort that comes through the numbing sameness of repetition. Loveless marriages like Lester and Carolyn's exist because neither partner possesses the willingness to break the cycle. And the children they think they're protecting by staying together are often the biggest victims of their sham.\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty is the first feature film directed by Sam Mendes, who has an extensive background in theater, but displays a sureness that many veteran filmmakers are unable to match. At times evoking elements of Todd Solondz' controversial Happiness and Ang Lee's brilliant The Ice Storm, American Beauty weds compelling drama with black comedy. The movie is character-driven, but the three protagonists are so expertly developed that we are drawn to them for the entire two hour running time. Spacey, Bening, and Birch all give the kinds of top-notch performances that deserve (but do not always get) consideration at Oscar time. Spacey's Lester may be American Beauty's narrator, but, through a low-key portrayal that conveys all the angst and confusion of a particularly bad teenage experience, Birch makes Jane the film's emotional focal point.\r\n\r\nIf there's a weakness in American Beauty, it's in the way the story is structured. Spacey's voiceover narrative effectively kills a great deal of narrative tension when, during an opening scene, he reveals the film's ending. This approach is often forgivable if there's a compelling dramatic reason for it, but that isn't the case here. In fact, the use of the voiceover allows American Beauty to close with more exposition than is necessary. We don't need to be told, for example, that one of the film's points is that we should learn to savor every moment of life and to see all the hidden beauty the world has to offer.\r\n\r\nendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall add some wonderful camera work, especially when it comes to close-ups. In most films, we rarely notice this kind of shot because it is used indiscriminately. However, in American Beauty, it serves the definite purpose of offering insight into a character's mindset. There are many close-ups in this film, and few (if any) are used for the banal purpose of varying shot selection. And Thomas Newman's dynamic, playful score compliments the picture's effective visual composition.\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains."

'American Beauty' is a comedy-drama film directed by British director Sam Mendes in his directorial debut. Since then, he won an Oscar and went on to direct 'Road to Perdition' (2002) and 'Skyfall' (2012).\r\n\r\nThe movie focuses on a man named Lester (Kevin Spacey), who is going through an intense mid-life crisis. His materialistic wife Carolyn (Annette Benning), ignores him and treats objects like people and people like objects. His 16 year old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is insecure and is saving up to get her breasts done, she also blames her insecurity on her parents.\r\n\r\nAlso, Lester's job is hanging on a thread, he feels as if he is unwanted and does not want to continue to work there.\r\n\r\nThe family also have new next door neighbors moving in, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) with his wife and son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley).\r\n\r\nOne night, Lester reluctantly joins his wife to go see their daughter perform a cheer-leading routine at her high school. It's there that Lester sees something he truly desires, her name is Angela (Mena Suvari). Angela is a good friend of Jane's ironically, and Lester starts to imagine this young girl in many sexual scenarios. Who can blame him? He hasn't been intimate with his wife for god knows how long, and Angela's features including; blonde hair, blue eyes, and red lips are enough for Lester to lust over this young girl. Is it wrong for a man in his 40s to lust over a teenage girl who has no idea about his dirty fantasies? As long as he doesn't act upon it, then he isn't doing something illegal, but morally, it is wrong.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ricky seems to have a sort of fascination for Lester's daughter, Jane. Her natural looks and constant belief that she isn't beautiful makes him more attracted and obsessed with her.\r\n\r\nLester decides to change his life around, bossing around his wife and smoking pot and even bulking up to impress the young Angela. Angela, drugs and quitting his dead-end job are the solutions to ending his mid-life crisis.\r\n\r\n'American Beauty' is a beautifully filmed picture, with gorgeous cinematography by the late Conrad L. Hall and sure-handed direction from then-first time director Sam Mendes is astonishing and it's no wonder why he won an Oscar for this.\r\n\r\nThe second half of this movie does get a little slow-paced, and it does drag. But this movie was a very warped experience with all of the emotional disconnection, and I was still gripped. This is one of the best movies of the 1990s, along with 'Schindler's List' (1993) and 'Goodfellas' (1990)."

                    "review": "Over the years, many films have taken a dark look at the supposedly perfect ideal of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear family. For many, the suburban life is the American dream. For others, however, it can turn into a twisted nightmare of unfulfilled desires, repressed needs, and **** hopes. Because of the necessity to keep up appearances, a serene facade often conceals a breeding ground for dysfunction, anxiety, and hypocrisy. Directors like David Lynch have made this their playground. Lynch in particular delights in depicting the root causes of social decay in suburbia - and he does it by autopsy. American Beauty is not as dark as a Lynch project, since it allows for small moments of redemption, but it mines the same general territory.\r\n\r\nIf there's a rule in American cinema that all families not named Brady must be dysfunctional, then American Beauty does nothing to violate it. Most teenagers think their parents are strange, but, in the case of Jane Burnham (Thora Birch, whose largest previous big screen role was in Alaska), this is as much a state of reality as it is a state of mind. Her father, Lester (Kevin Spacey), is suffering through a mid-life crisis. At the age of 42, he has become apathetic to everything. \"Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser,\" he confesses at one point, \"And they're right. I have lost something. I didn't always feel this sedated.\" Meanwhile, Jane's mother, Carolyn (Annette Bening), places such value on status that she has turned into a \"bloodless, money-grubbing freak\" who has no time for any form of intimacy. Her creed: \"You cannot count on anyone except yourself.\" She and Lester continue in their dead marriage for their daughter's sake and so they'll look normal to the outside world. In a moment of clarity, Lester admits, \"Our marriage is just for show - a commercial for how normal we are, when we're anything but.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty is the first feature film directed by Sam Mendes, who has an extensive background in theater, but displays a sureness that many veteran filmmakers are unable to match. At times evoking elements of Todd Solondz' controversial Happiness and Ang Lee's brilliant The Ice Storm, American Beauty weds compelling drama with black comedy. The movie is character-driven, but the three protagonists are so expertly developed that we are drawn to them for the entire two hour running time. Spacey, Bening, and Birch all give the kinds of top-notch performances that deserve (but do not always get) consideration at Oscar time. Spacey's Lester may be American Beauty's narrator, but, through a low-key portrayal that conveys all the angst and confusion of a particularly bad teenage experience, Birch makes Jane the film's emotional focal point.\r\n\r\nIf there's a weakness in American Beauty, it's in the way the story is structured. Spacey's voiceover narrative effectively kills a great deal of narrative tension when, during an opening scene, he reveals the film's ending. This approach is often forgivable if there's a compelling dramatic reason for it, but that isn't the case here. In fact, the use of the voiceover allows American Beauty to close with more exposition than is necessary. We don't need to be told, for example, that one of the film's points is that we should learn to savor every moment of life and to see all the hidden beauty the world has to offer.\r\n\r\nMendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall add some wonderful camera work, especially when it comes to close-ups. In most films, we rarely notice this kind of shot because it is used indiscriminately. However, in American Beauty, it serves the definite purpose of offering insight into a character's mindset. There are many close-ups in this film, and few (if any) are used for the banal purpose of varying shot selection. And Thomas Newman's dynamic, playful score compliments the picture's effective visual composition.\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains."

His use of subtle lighting and luring music paint the picture of normality and even the mundaneness of the middle class. Bold reds and slow-motion shots break through the cracks to show the turmoil hidden behind the fluff of those red roses.\r\nIt is the ultimate American contradiction of wishing to be protected and yearning to be free at the same time. This is shown through the lives of the Burnham family: Lester with all his hopes banked in the past, his daughter Jane grasping for the future, and the perfect materialized wife in Carolyn. They are each trapped by the roles society has forced upon them or that they have forced on themselves. Mendes asks, is it possible to have the comfort of safety and also maintain the thrill of freedom?\r\nMaybe the fault some find in \"American Beauty\" is that it does not answer any questions, but proposes many. It presents a story that is as complicated to the viewer as it is to the characters within it. It does not claim to have answers because it knows there are no clear-cut solutions in life."

The guy who hates **** people is **** and his wife is a mute. Jane's friend isn't promiscuous, she's a total ****. Their friendship is baffling. Lester's wife is so materialistic that she shoots him in the head. Everything is over the top and trying to hold the mirror to society in one breath. It comes off as really preachy and righteous."

I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. \"mother!\"), I think \"Requiem For A Dream\" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that \"best of both worlds\" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for. Do I ever want to see it again? Not really, no. But, man, did Ellen Burstyn ever deliver a career-defining performance, if I ever saw one."

First in this movie, I must say, impress the directing, brilliantly combined with the topic - drugs, how they affect you and destroy your life. No chance, you miss that. Typical for the dramas, the accent is put on the details, the visual  influence by facial impressions and sounds. Here, oh Lord.. Crazyyy directing. We could argue a lot about what's more important - good directing or good story and in the end we end up without conclusive answer, BUT some movies just impress you with that art of setting things in place. Second, Jared Leto in main role makes the movie even more touching.  This man is god damn beautiful, talented and most of all there is something about him, that let him very very much impact you and drive you in the story. And that last thing represent supreme characterization of a masterpieces. The whole acting by every one of the actor crew could not be better. .\n\nShortly, perfect cinematography and soundtracks, story and acting, basically everything.

Thanks to Aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, I found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. Due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies I've ever watched. The problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down.\nIt's not the only or the major issue I've with this movie. The real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of Sara Goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of Harry and Marion. Also, the oscar-worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn (I really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, Sara Goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than Harry and Marion's. I really didn't found myself relate to the characters of Harry and Marion so much, despite the great performances that Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly gave.\nThe perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of Tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, Marlon Wayans was very good though.  I love Requiem for a Dream. It's a movie to experience not to watch. It really proves that Darren Aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.\n\n(7.5/10)"

Directed by Darren Aronofsky, it has a screenplay by Hubert Selby Jr. and the participation of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.\n\nThis is one of the most disturbing films I've seen. But this is not a defect. In fact, its the greatest quality of this film: it changes the way we think. Shocking and assertive, it shows how a person is able to dispose of their own luck, focusing on what he want and wasting the good things he already have. And the more disturbing becomes when we recognize, in the attitudes of the characters, our own attitudes or people we know. Decidedly, its a film that puts anyone thinking, it was made for this and not as entertainment.\n\nThe script is exceptional, the concept is innovative. The way the director drove all the work is very competent and was decisive for the final result. Speaking about final, the end of the film is disturbing and not recommended for sensitive people, as well as several other scenes. The actors performance is good, particularly Ellen Burstyn, who is unrecognizable in her role. The sets and costumes are regular. The photography is excellent, becoming darker and sinister as the characters go \"down the pit\". The soundtrack, by Clint Mansell, is one of the most powerful and disturbing in recent cinema, having been numerous times reused in various other artistic works, films, journalistic works etc."

Her son, Harry, is a drug dealer and an addict, along with his pal Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion, whom wished that she could be a fashion designer.\n\nSara spends most of her time watching her favourite reality show on TV. One day, she gets selected to appear on that show. She wishes to go on with her special red dress but cannot fit in it due to her weight. She goes on a diet but doesn't seem to all work that well. Her next choice is diet pills, which wasn't a very good idea. Sara starts taking them irregularly and develops an addiction.\n\nHarry, Tyrone and Marion on the other hand, struggle to keep up in the drug business and begin losing money and drugs.\n\nAs the film progresses, we see all of this get worse as their addictions spiral out of control.\n\nRequiem for a Dream is really sickening and it breaks all expectations. It is absolutely fantastic but not one of those films you would feel comfortable watching twice (although I have watched it more than twice). Every actor in this film play their roles brilliantly, especially Ellen Burstyn. It's incredibly gut-wrenching. The story and writing by Darren Aronofsky is phenomenal. It's so well written it blows my mind. I easily give this movie a 10/10."

What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like \"Salinui chueok \". But once again I was wrong. \"Oldboy\" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10"

Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.\n\nFlawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.\n\nThe fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.\n\nWhat is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.\n\nNevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.\n\nOldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts. I think it's the first Korean film I watch, and it definitely won't be the last. Just help me with some recommendations, if you wouldn't mind! :)\n\n(8.5/10)"

The plot relies heavily on subjects such as love and revenge, but in a manner I've not yet seen before. It has some major twists that were shocking. The action / fighting sequences were the only things that were somewhat poorly done, with actors clearly missing each other while still pretending to be hit, but in the end that doesn't make the overall experience any less emotional."

Oldboy is by far the best movie of the trilogy and one of the best Asian films of all time.

It is rare I feel sympathy for a villain, but this film makes it happen with the great writing that went on with it. If you have a soft stomach, this may not be the film for you as it is a revenge film. Like most revenge films it is brutal and, without spoiling anything, has an event occur that was rather harsh to stomach down. If you can get through that, you will end up watching a piece of art in motion. A true masterpiece."

Full of grand passions, bloodthirsty violence, with a wicked sense of jet black humor, \"Oldboy\" is a sadistic masterpiece. The director, Park Chan-wook, is one among several filmmakers who've made South Korean cinema what it is today, and requires a viewing at least once by serious moviegoers.\r\n\r\nThe plot is utterly unique: Seoul businessman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi), is kidnapped one rainy evening by parties unknown. He awakens in a seedy motel room  complete with hideously tacky wallpaper, threadbare carpet, a double bed, and a television  but in reality, it serves as a cell. Days, months, and years go by with no explanation given for his incarceration. A daily meal comes through a tiny slot in the door, and every so often sleeping gas seeps in as well. From the television in his room, he learns that he is the prime suspect for the murder of his wife  and now, even if he escapes, he's a wanted man.\r\n\r\nFifteen years later, Dae-su awakes one day on a grass-covered roof of a downtown building in Seoul, outfitted with a finely tailored suit, a cell phone, and a wallet stuffed with cash. Before Dae-su can begin a new life, he must answer several key questions about his imprisonment. Only after he has these answers can he exact his revenge and turn the page. Meanwhile, his captor decides to turn Dae-su's quest for answers into a cruel, exhausting game that will push him to his limits. Additionally, he has just five days to not to only find out why he was held captive, but to also identify his tormentor, and seek his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe committed performance by Min-sik Choi strikes a genuinely tragic note amid the mayhem and cartoonish excesses of violence. He does a marvelous job walking on the edge of insanity, while retaining likability and compassion from the audience. Superlative acting across the board, and a pulsating score to compliment the arresting imagery, while the true astuteness of the script will reward only on further viewings.\r\n\r\n\"Oldboy\" has a wild, twisty storyline on such an epic scale emotionally, and it rarely slows down to consider the logic of some of its most outrageous plot contortions. The revelation in the third act is a bit of a letdown considering the thrilling, ambitious set up. Cinematic in the extreme, the movie has an emotional core that will leave some viewers stunned, yet others disgusted. As tough as it is to endure  it is brutal, yet brilliant  and it is undoubtedly a work of art.\r\n\r\n\"Oldboy\" is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, directed by Park Chan-wook, preceded by \"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\" (2002) and followed by \"Lady Vengeance\" (2005)."

All in all I liked the film. I just wish that I understood more of it. It was stylish and well executed. It was sober but also slightly unique. It certainly looked good. It was a disappointingly dull sound mix. It was not very dynamic and lacked enthusiasm; it was too similar to a sound-mix you'd expect in a comedy but disappointing because I expected more. The music was pretty good though. I don't think that I got the story first time round. I watched it again and understood it and I really liked it. The problem was that there were a few plot-holes that made it harder to swallow. It was also a touch long in some places. The ending was good except it could have lost a scene without losing anything. It slightly reminded me of Pulp Fiction (1994). Good fundamental story and great style suffer from disappointing binding elements."

                    "review": "Oldboy is often cited as a masterpiece direct from South Korea. For me, it simply was not my thing. The violence was not too much for me, as is often the case. Though excessive in spots, Oldboy simply falls out of my range of enjoyment. As it stands, it is an entertaining ride with a disappointing conclusion that really lets the air of Park-Chan Wook's claustrophobic thriller.\r\n\r\nShot in a way that makes the viewer feel entriely claustrophobic alongside Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik), the film really does a great job capturing his anguish, loneliness, and torment, as he is locked up for 15 years for reasons unknown to him. The film's thrills continue as he meets the far too trusting Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung) and the mysterious Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), who is the reason he is locked up in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe fim's willingness to dive into shocking violence is a problem, namely the tongue sequence. It makes sense, but no thank you. Other than that, the acting is well shot and well choreographed, especially when Oh Dae-su fights the men in the compound. A masterfully shot sequence, it almost made me a believer. That scene in particular is not just well shot, but Chan-wook Park does a terrific job creating tension and thrills in that scene, as well as the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nThis is about where the noticeable positives stop for me, personally. My list of complaints is admittedly longer. Firstly, the beginning. Maybe I am dumb, but I barely realized it was the same guy at the beginning. I got what they were trying to do, but the beginning sequence of Oh Dae-su being very drunk and then winding up in this prison for 15 years was horrifically executed. It was incoherent and made no sense while watching it. I obviously figured out that was what happened at some point, but the film made no attempt to make it a coherent transition. Instead, it showed a drunk guy and then a guy locked up asking why he is being held with very little connection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the biggest complaint is the end. Oh Dae-su is held for 15 years because he saw Lee Joo-win have sex with his sister and then he told his friend who spread the news around the school. The sister killed herself as a result (oh wait, excuse me, she was dropped). That is why this happened. Even worse, Chan-wook Park then decided it would be fun if the film became absolute nonsense by having Oh Dae-su have sex with Mi-do who is his daughter. Brilliant twist really. How did he wind up doing this, you ask? Oh well Lee Joo-win, in his endless quest to get payback for his dead sister, had a woman hypnotize the two of them to put them in situations where they will fall in love. This is not a problem with coherence. I understood it. However, these explanations were less than satisfying. I was already torn on whether or not the overall tone and feel were up my alley, but the ending convinced me that Oldboy was simply not my thing. For me, the ending was not just unsatisfying, but outright dumb.\r\n\r\nI get that everyone else loves Oldboy. That is fine. I did not hate it. I just would be hard pressed to say I like it. That said, the overwhelming praise will lead to me watching this one again later on. Though, it may be a while since it took me a while to watch it once to begin with since I was convinced it would not be my thing. Now that I have watched it, it seems that my initial impressions were correct. Though I loved the way it was shot and the action in the film is terrific, the incoherent beginning and awful conclusion is a major buzzkill. Sorry."

Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended."

The rest of the time is occupied with demanding, brilliant material for the eye and brain. Thus, though it may fail as drama, the movie succeeds as visual art and becomes another irritating, dazzling achievement of Stanley Kubrick, one of the most erratic and original talents in U.S. cinema."

Now before going on about how I wouldn't say I like this movie, that it's a masterpiece...\n\nLet me say this, this is a well-filmed, uneasy, exciting movie about the potential evolution of mankind, while this won't necessarily be the path we will choose anytime soon, I think that in the grand scope of things, and I mean grand, this movie explores potential vital things that the human race will have to endure.\n\nI like everything up to the point of the very end, I think it's a bit creepy and maybe a bit forced that Dave became a, well you know.\n\nFor a movie made back in 1968 where there was literally little to no CGI, it's impressive. Does it still hold up by today's standards? Ha, No but I understood the intention.\n\nIs this a masterpiece of a space film, well that's purely based on your perspective, and personally I don't think so.\n\nIt's not the story it's just that it maybe takes a little bit too long on some scenes, it would've been better if there were more scenarios happening, also some plot lines and scenes are a bit stupid, maybe it's just me but I saw the whole reading the lips of the 2 characters an obvious thing that would happen, but it's still all around great.\n\nI'm gonna give this an 8/10, for some, this may be boring, but for others fairly interesting.\nWe need a more modern space movie with this type of film prowess, done correctly, only this time make it have the 70s, and 80s flare to it, focusing perhaps on a specific period of human space evolution.\n\nNothing like the Cloverfield paradox, something Drama based, uneasy, and realistic.\n\nSpace may be the final frontier but we first need to conquer reviews."

But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.\n\nThe story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.\n\nOverall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending. As much as I like Oliver and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, two of my childhood favourites, and the brilliant Lion in Winter to me this is it... the best film of 1968. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Its quite old fashioned looking nowadays but then, of course, the film dates from the late 1960s so thats hardly surprising, more inevitable. As others have, I believe, argued, it feels very relevant in modern day society, I say that with my thought being the main themes present, which I'd say are isolation, humanity (the future of) and within that, community (the importance of community), plus of course our reliance on technology.\n\nIt wouldn't feel quite so impactful if it weren't for the stirring use/placement of classical music. Its a very atmospheric film I'd say and I liked that I could hear the more mechanical, automated type noises in the background of scenes, reminding us that technology is relied upon to keep the spacecraft operating, adding to the artificial or sterile feel to the place, which in this instance is good, as unlike in other films, it (to me) felt genuinely unnerving, how close to the perceived environment the viewer felt through the use of sound and music. There are times when there's no dialogue and all that can be heard is, for example, the sound of oxygen flowing into a spacesuit, to keep the person alive while investigating outside the vessel.\n\nThere is definitely a feel of 'big brother' about it - with the computer device HAL 9000 being the inbuilt 'voice of technological reason' you could say. That voice being quite unemotional, quite matter-of-fact (you could say, robotic, funnily enough). There is something unsettling about that somehow. I thought it was interesting how said device/being seemingly challenged the humans/astronauts on board by making some potentially challenging observations and raising questions. I felt it was a well thought out script and it inevitably was quite thought provoking, in terms of me wondering where society is heading in the medium term. I find it hard to imagine we'll all routinely be in space but then no doubt people would find it very hard to believe we could interact with others by video screens in real time as is shown on this film released in the late 60s and that is now possible via iPhones and Facetime and the like.\n\nI noted the use of what seemed to me like pinhole camera angles/shots used, whereby the viewer only sees the middle of the image, or at other times around the sort of border of the shot the surroundings appear to be pointing inwards. This added to the sense of claustrophobia, I felt. I'd say there's almost a hypnotic sense to it.\n\nI was just watching this at home on a smallish (under 28 inch) screen but yet I felt surprisingly engrossed in it and I quite enjoyed it - its certainly one of the better sci-fi films I've seen, so I'd happily recommend it and give it a high star rating."

Clarke\u2019s short story \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d which was expanded to a book and part of a bigger arc. Actually Arthur C. Clark was a mathematician and physicist so he knows what he is writing about. A lot of physicists published science fiction novels to earn a bit of extra money but mostly with an alias to avoid harming their reputation. This is the reason why there are so many working concepts in science fiction even when many things are embellished. Together with director Stanley Kurbick\u2019s dedication and talents it became a hit. Also I think this movie is the reason why science fiction has classic music added to it (Think it works well by the way). The story starts with a flashback to the far prehistoric era. Showing how prehumans developed the skills or idea to use tools while a black monolith is present. The story continues in the future where mankind has evolve to a near Earth spacefaring society. A monolith was found on the Moon which far predates human civilization and did send out a signal to Jupiter. The USA will build a spaceship and send a crew to secretly investigate Jupiter for answers together with a supercomputer named HAL 9000. This is the set up for the story. It is an epic journey full of dilemmas. Everything works quite well and I see no missteps here. Many scenes are common pop culture knowledge as things are referenced in countless other medias. To be fair the story telling can be too slow for others and it is a frequent complaint that I see as valid even if I disagree. Another point is the ending that confused many people. There is the anecdote that Arthur C. Clark visited another country (USA I think but I am not sure) and the guy who controlled is passport recognized him and said to him that he would not let him into the country if he did not explain the ending. Visually this movie is impressive. I think no other word than epic is valid. The sets, scenery and visuals are so immersive that we never doubted anything. For those who disagree: There is the conspiracy theory that Stanley Kubrick filmed the moon landing (This is not a joke). The cast is remarkably good. There is Keir Duella as Dr. David Bowman. He is an excellent protagonist and delivers a praiseworthy performance. Douglas Rain is the voice of HAL 9000 and he flashes out the character in an excellent way. I think his voice acting improves the experience a lot. Gary Lockwood as Dr. Frank Poole is sometimes a bit overlooked and deserves credits too. All the others deliver a good performance and this cast is truly excellent. Of cause I praise Stanley Kubrick. He is a legendary director and his filmography is full of some of the greatest or better said well know and influential movies of his era. Then there is the music. This movie is like I said the reason classical music is associated with science fiction films. It has a lot of famous tracks like \u201cAlso sprach Zarathustra\u201d, \u201cLux Aeterna\u201d and \u201cThe blue Danube\u201d. It fits strangely perfect here. Overall this is a must see in movie history. Bonus knowledge: Some of the shown technology was so spot on that it was used in the lawsuit between Apple and Samsung about the invention of the tablet (Again not a joke)."

Through the long sequence of ships moving through space, through the seemingly endless stargate sequence, even when it's literally just a black screen, I'm hooked; hypnotized, entranced. Once it's starts, there's no going back.\n\nThis movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up. The effects are some of the best of all time. The sound is terrifying. The visuals are stunning.\n\nThis is easily one of the most beautiful films ever. Everything comes together so perfectly. Lighting, set design, costumes, special effects, music, colors, sound, editing; It's all cinematic perfection.\n\nThis is the ultimate Sci-fi film.\nOne of the few movies that I would call Perfect."

This is despite the fact that the movie is undeniably boring. But slowly hurtling through space could be nothing but boring, which only adds to the iconic realism. It is unendingly shocking that this movie was made in the 60's, and yet manages to stand head and shoulders above any other movie's representation of living in the dark vastness of space. Even Interstellar ends up feeling somewhat childish after seeing this. The 2 astronaut leads may seem \"cold and distant\" but are exactly what someone in their position would be. The celestial ballet Kubrick manages to convey/visualize is certainly spiritual in nature, even if no religious thought sits behind it. This film's prescience in visualizing the future (i.e. now - the present) is stupefying. The \"Hal\" storyline holds as much suspense as a Hitchcock movie. I was underwhelmed by the very end of the film, but I have also come to believe that Kubrick is both bad at, and apathetic to, the art of ending movies. I don't think he finds any joy in the end of movies, and it shows. But even certifiable flaws cannot upend this movie's clear status as 21st Century Masterpiece."

Secondly, the futuristic feel and the fact that so many things where predict that exists now but in those times didn't really exist, is also insane. So from this aspect I agree, the movie is incredible. As for the plot itself - I do think it could've been better. Yes, now people are guessing what it meant or explaining it etc, but there are many movies which are much less known and also show things ambiguously, but people bash them and say they don't mean nothing. I really enjoy most of other Kubrick's movies, but this is somewhat in the middle - I like the visuals, but I didn't like the ending that much and also I think some shots are too long - like you can watch at 8 times speed and nothing changes really."

Considered a classic, I only discovered it this week (in 2021), which makes it very difficult to bridge the fifty years-gap between its genesis and my very first look. That being said I still can (even if partially) comprehend why this feature is so important to the hearts of many. Yet it is not my case.\n\nOf course, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" benefits from exceptional visuals, sequences and staging. Yes, the colours, the lighting, the perspective and the montage are outstanding. Obviously the soundtrack is really intense and adds a lot to the story (or what seems to be so), even if such a sound environment reveals quite a lot of Kubrick's megalomania when conceptualizing this movie. It is undeniable that the acting (even if represents so few of the work) is great. To conclude with positive aspects I would say that the messages behind this feature are really interesting.\n\nDespite these assets what ruined the experience for me was (amongst others) the movie length. I totally get that the concepts of space and time are really close and that representing such a fact in a movie requires both silences and very dark sequences. But here it is just too much. If you saw the first ten minutes of it you do know what I mean. The story is way too confusing. Events succeed each other without any obvious link or explanation. If Kubrick manages to make us deduce some symbols and causes of events he also surprisingly manages to make his movie just unintelligible and messy. If you witnessed the twenty last minutes of it you do know what I'm talking about. In overall the third and fourth acts are simply mindnumbing in addition to be punctuated by this endless weird psychedelic sequence. Until the end, I looked for something to hold onto, I looked for meaning in all those silent scenes I saw, but nothing came. It gets weirder and weirder until Kubrick finally lets you out of his indelicate, jerky experience."

The story is normal, the characters don't really get through you and the ending made no sense to me. The movie was unnecessarily slow paced and too long (2\u00bd hours). Movie didn't have any proper explaination. I just think this movie is too much overrated. I liked this movie just because it was ahead of its time wheather you talk about visual effects, general idea of the movie and the idea of what space was like.

            "review": "My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible Scottish nobility, in particular the treachery of the future \"try, try again\" hero - King Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since."

The film follows the story of Wallace, a hero and freedom fighter who staunchly believed in his cause, fighting against oppression. While critics may argue about the historical inaccuracies present in the film, one must recognize that absolute historical fidelity is rare in Hollywood epics. What matters most is that \"Braveheart\" captures the essence of standing up to tyranny, confronting bullies, and finding the courage to face fears despite overwhelming adversity.\n\nOne cannot review \"Braveheart\" without mentioning its iconic battle speech, a moment that has earned its place in cinema history. The speech, coupled with excellent action sequences, offers a breathtaking cinematic experience that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nMel Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is both passionate and believable, contributing to the movie's lasting impact. It's clear that \"Braveheart\" has been a significant influence in the industry, inspiring future historical epics like \"Gladiator\" and beyond.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Braveheart\" is more than just a film; it's an inspiring tale of resilience, courage, and the human spirit. Its blend of storytelling, action, and historical inspiration make it a must-see for anyone interested in epic cinema."

Mel Gibson has a way with film making because I\u2019ve only seen 2 of his movies and somehow they make you not like the films when you watch them but when you finish you end up really enjoying it. Mel Gibson brings his all in the lead with the Scottish accent to go along with it he did a great job. So did the rest of the cast and just like the Rambo movies they really make you hate the bad guys and of course there from England but they do it in the best way some people you may think are good but then flip it on your head and betray their people. The cinematography of the movie is great the Scotland lands have never looked so good its so well lit and very beautiful to look at. But the main thing I love so much is the music. All the music in this movie even though they over use some of the same songs it doesn\u2019t matter at all the bagpipes sounds so good that I now want to go to Scotland, go to a music festival there and hear the music I adore it. But there are some bad things like the main motive is cliche fall in love, get married, girl dies, go fight but the real story is great Scotland fighting for there freedom. Then even though this came out before Passion of the Christ if you watched that movie first then you can see the same stuff he did like having the main character\u2019s family watching him get tortured and then someone from his past walks past the family so maybe you can say that was a Braveheart shot but since I saw Passion first I called it a Passion shot. Overall yeah it was really good action was solid, blood was good, story nice but sometimes generic watching it during these times. Next review is Parasite though let\u2019s see if it deserves its 5 Oscars."

It is the story of William Wallace (and with that also Robert the Bruce) in one of the most interesting and celebrated times in Scottish history. It is a battle for independence from England with schemes and lot of struggles. It is a nice Hollywood version with passion, emotion and glory. It is one of the most immersive movies of its time and deserved its praise by fans and critics. The real story behind it is not as black and white or glorious. It is from a historical standpoint really incorrect and awful (The list of errors would be longer than a summary of the movie). This does however not influence my rating as entertainment and documentation are separate genres. For itself it was Mel Gibson grand project as he was director, writer, producer and main actor. You can always feel the passion, heart and soul that was injected into this project. It uses clever techniques to build up the characters and story. Lets start with the actors. Mel Gibson is a great William Wallace and delivers a remarkable performance. Angus MacFadyen is a strong Robert the Bruce who struggles with his crown. Patrick McGoham as Edward I (Longshanks) is a magnificent bastard and one of the best villains I have seen. I shorten my praise here and say all actors deliver a good to great performance. Then there are the beautiful sets and locations in the movie. They filmed in Scotland and Ireland and it looks awesome. On a sidenote there are holiday trips for Scottish movie locations as many movies made them popular. Then there are the battles. They are intense, immersive and you always feel excited. The story and characters together create a great atmosphere. Also there is some good humor in the movie. While I have no complaints in general I think that the ending can be a bit of a downer. Overall this is an excellent movie that pushes all the right buttons. It rightfully deserves the Oscars and acclaim. It is a must see except for history buffs or historians."

Even though well over two decades have passed but everything from the film's battle scenes to the soundtrack are fresh in my memory. Braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax. Much of the early film concentrates on Wallace's love for Murron. Their courtship is unhurried, yet this is all preparation. The real meat of the story, which includes political betrayal, and dramatic battles, is yet to come. Braveheart is a brutal, bloody motion picture, but the violence is not gratuitous. The maiming, decapitations, and other assorted gruesome details make Wallace's world seem real and immediate. It is a testimony to the directorial skills of Mel Gibson that despite being three hours long this film never drags, in fact we the audience are transfixed. Braveheart is one of the best epics ever filmed and people would be talking about this movie fifty years from now.(Gibson's masterpiece)."

That's in large part due to Mel Gibson's remarkable and risk-taking direction, and the masterful editing.\n\nLong shots, wide camera angles, and quick cuts in the dialogue scenes as well as the battle sequences gave this movie a lively atmosphere, and therefore made it a unique experience that helped it to stand out from the other historical epic movies.\n\nThat being said, I found the tonal shifts completely outputting. The movie kept moving from a somber to a lighter tone throughout its runtime to match the current situations and events. That made some important moments have less impact on me, such as; some dramatic moments didn't work as mush as it should, the climax of the plot felt sudden and not well prepared for it, etc. While it didn't take me a long time to adapt to the new tone, the episodic nature of the movie is quite annoying and distracting.\n\nThe romantic relationship between Wallace and his wife was pretty fine and acceptable at first, but then it overstayed its welcome a little bit. Whilst the reason for that is quite understandable, I couldn't help but cringe for a while.\n\nThe villain is very menacing and almost everything about him is great, except that he provided us with an exposition of his plans many times. But, fortunately, likewise some cheesy lines, these scenes were justified by Gibson's excellent direction that gave them an epic sense, and therefore made them more passable.\n\nRandall Wallace's screenplay is more than enough to make the movie match its ambition. From the way we witness our protagonist from his childhood to become the hero he is, to the miraculous narrative control on the abundance of side characters and their sub-plots. All that made Braveheart a larger-than-life historical tale, and I don't care about how historically accurate it is because it's a great movie!\n\n(8/10)"

                    "review": "The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be.\r\n\r\nWhat I Personally Liked About \"Braveheart\":\r\nLet's start off by addressing the fact that this film features some of the most spectacular locations ever caught on camera. The shooting locations found in both Scotland and Ireland fit the production perfectly and breathed life into the backdrop in a way most movies can only dream about. The stylish way the locations are presented from a visual standpoint seems highly influenced by the eighties' output of Akira Kurosawa, and let's be honest, there are certainly worse directors you could derive inspiration from. As for the acting, Mel Gibson has fairly decent chemistry with all of the cast members he plays off. This is an admirable trait considering the fact that the spotlight is on him so often in this film. Unlike other three hour ensemble pieces from the nineties (\"Short Cuts,\" \"Magnolia,\" etc.), \"Braveheart\" contains a straightforward narrative and much of that is fueled by Gibson alone. In addition, the battle sequences are well-framed and well-choreographed which creates an exciting sense of urgent realism. It also contains one of the finest, most memorable battle cries of its decade when William Wallace says \"They may take our lives, but they'll never **** freedom!\"\r\n\r\nWhat I Personally Disliked About \"Braveheart\":\r\nFor as good an actor as Gibson is, this film would have benefitted from tighter direction. You can feel every ounce of weight in its length and that is not a complimentary statement. Often times, it moves at a snail's pace with patches that serve to bore the story into one's head instead of letting the moments unfold naturally. Basically, it is an epic for the sake of being an epic. Another drawback is that many of the movie's villains feel like generic knock-offs when compared to the fully fleshed heroes who oppose them. From a cinematic standpoint, as we have learned over the decades, a hero is only as strong and as righteous as his villain is evil and crafty. The forgettable villains in this film inadvertently weaken the accomplishments of our brave Scots.\r\n\r\nMy Overall Impression of \"Braveheart\":\r\nWhile it is a bit long in the tooth and a bit one-sided in the characterization department, this is still a reasonable example of what Mel Gibson was capable of delivering when he wasn't portraying crazed cops or reimagined mavericks. This is his show all the way and you can tell he tried to make the best of it."

The acting is good throughout, the action is very exciting and well done, the score is great, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The costumes are also very well done, even if completely historically inaccurate. The length is also very much justified as there is always enough going on to keep you fully wrapped up in the proceedings. However, even though all of those things are good to great, there is enough going wrong to take away from the overall product. Firstly, the violence, though not graphic, is entirely numbing. There is just too much of it and by the end, it loses all of its impact as you are so desensitized to it. Also, I just struggled as times with Mel Gibson here. He just does not look right, he just seems so out of place here. His acting was good and all, but I think somebody else could have fit the look better. Finally, the historical inaccuracies are bad. This is not inaccurate like a film like Inglourious Basterds is inaccurate, as that one has no false pretense of accuracy and is very much theatrical and gloriously inaccurate. Here, Braveheart does not necessarily pass itself off as accurate, but it certainly would like you to believe that it is and I simply cannot do so. If it was only a little inaccurate, then ok, but the blatant disregard for what happens is annoying to say the least. Overall, Braveheart is a pretty good film and is certainly worth a watch."

After the English takes his land kills his brother, father, and wife he begins a revolt. This revolution ends up taking on epic proportions. The reason this revolution becomes so powerful is mainly because of William Wallace. He just is a motivational leader and his undying belief in freedom is contagious. In fact before one of the bigger battles of the movie Wallace makes the quote, \u201cSure I\u2019d love to settle down, have a farm, and raise a family. But I can\u2019t do any of that, not without the English taking it. I\u2019m willing to lay down my life for others so that they may live the dream that I have. \u201d It was his belief in freedom and a land of their own that helps him lead his troops so well.\r\nNot only is the plot amazing, but the actors who preform it are truly stunning. Throughout the movie you can feel it, as Mel Gibson (William Wallace) yearns for a better life.  Every time Wallace loses someone you care about you can feel the pain in your heart too. Also when Wallace was betrayed to the English you felt everything in you die a little bit. This movie and the actors within it really help you respect and treasure the freedom we have now. It was because of great men like William Wallace that anyone has any true freedom.\r\nThe impact of this movie is incredible. I can guarantee that anyone who sees this movie will have a hard time not screaming freedom randomly. Personally I felt that all the themes of this movie were life changing, and impacted the way I\u2019ll think of day to day life forever. In my opinion the only place this movie fell short was it wasn\u2019t long enough. I would advise anyone who wants to live life to its fullest to watch this movie.\r\n-Patrick Brooks"

The costumes don't match (even the kilts didn't exist yet at Wallace's time), battles didn't happened that way, Gibson's performance was poor and theatrical, photography is boring and ordinary and the psychological depth of all characters is comparable to a dry river in Summer. Oscars for this film? Yes, he got some (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects and Best Makeup)... but I don't even want to know how it's happened!

It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another \"dog\" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal \"Tarantinoesque\" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!"

It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

                    "review": "I will start this review by making a warning that I give whenever I dedicate myself to a film directed by Quentin Tarantino: I am not an admirer of this director. On the contrary. I'm even quite critical about his work. Not even Jesus Christ pleased everyone, did He? However, from this filmmaker's long list of works, this film is one of the ones I liked the most, I must confess.\n\nThe film is based on the failed attempt to rob a jeweler, in order to steal a load of diamonds. The gang is highly professional and was hired by a boss who is superior to everyone. The degree of professionalism and commitment of the thieves reaches the point of not even knowing each other's names, using only nicknames created for the purpose. However, the failure revealed that one of the elements is actually a police informant. What remains is to find out which of the surviving elements is that informer.\n\nSome say that this film is very violent. I honestly don't agree. There are a lot of films out there that manage to be much harder to see than this, and I am thinking, for example of the long lists of horror gore (\"Hostel\", \"Saw\"). In any case, it is a movie for adults, in which Tarantino shows that he is very good when he does not sacrifice everything that makes a film work in favor of the look, style and technique. Superbly done and well written, it tells a story with logic and coherence.\n\nThe cast is excellent, and combines several big names like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself. I would personally highlight the performances of Keitel, Buscemi, Roth and, above all, Tierney for their quality. Technically, it is a discreet film, which almost clashes if we look at Tarantino's stylized and very visual films. Perhaps this is due to the mere fact that this film was the first major work in the director's career. Cheap to produce, as befits a film made outside the big studios, everything takes place in a restricted group of scenarios and there are few exterior scenes or effects, being a film based on dialogues and the interpersonal relationships of the various characters. Even the blood looked fake, actually.\n\nThis film is proof that it is not necessary to abuse stylization in cinema to make good films. Just having good actors, knowing how to direct them and telling a good story."

First of all, none of them have identities-the first sign of personality disorder.  Personality disorders are exaggerated in a work environment.  Michael Madsen is a psychopath (no emotion, enjoys hurting others).  Steve Buscemi is the sociopath (spreads gossip, disregards boundaries of others to damage relationships).   Harvey Keitel is codependent (emotional, concerned more about taking care of others than himself.  Tim Roth is introverted narcissist (seeking attention, acting wounded, bragging), Chris Penn is the extroverted narcissist, also called histrionic (over sexualized, flirting).  These people interact exactly the way they do in real life, the accuracy of these types is crazy.  I have studied psychology nearly a decade to understand these interactions as well as they are portrayed here.  Plus there is an acting class built into the movie, that adds so much dimension.  The culture of the police has good depth, the culture of the criminals has depth."

                    "review": "Tarantino is letting his teeth sink in on the characters more than the bangs and booms, to a degree that he embodies one.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nTarantino's game of assumption is a pretty standard equation. The writer and director, Quentin Tarantino is taking a discussion further than just a suggested idea in a bar. And on his side, before the argument even begins, is a crowd pleasing concept and enticing genre to follow. The film often tends to stay ahead of the game and provokes you, challenges you to be in sync with the storytelling. As a result a lot of time is spent upon placing the assumption, the imagination in your head as a viewer. Let's go through the scene where Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) tortures the cop.\n\nAt first, the condition, the premise is set by him. It helps you know the tone and endorses the upcoming event with a cautionary warning. And then comes the violence. But the violence isn't gruesome as it is painted and hyped in public opinion. Yes, there is literal blood baths in here, but I have seen much worse cringeworthy eye popping or screeching images. And I insist on its subtlety- if we can call it that- of the violence, is because most of it is left upon your imagination, innuendos are clear and crisp and hence the \"necessary\" clause goes out of the window.\n\nMaybe, that's why Madsen is shown leaving the music behind and come back to it, grooving as he yells out his final threat. That part, that dance, is the style that defines Tarantino's cinema. Before a shock is revealed which then turns itself into an ethical dilemma, what he is showcasing as a part of narrative is the style that we actually remember him and his films for. Reservoir Dogs is a flashy pop culture cinema, just like the conversations that it is brimming with, grounded by an eye on mythological creatures."

                    "review": "Reservoir Dogs was released in 1992 and was directed by Quentin Tarantino in his directorial debut. The film is about a group of strangers who band together for a jewellery heist, however after it goes terribly wrong they take refuge in a warehouse whilst they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover police officer. Because of this being his first film, it really shows throughout the film how ambitious and excited Tarantino was to be making it; the film is full of style and great direction.\n\nTo start off with, the film feels very raw and realistic which I loved and nothing feels altered to fit the accustoms of cinema, and I could genuinely believe that all of this stuff happened in real life. It is extremely impressive for an independent film and cleverly made throughout.\n\nEven though the film's cast are known only by colours, they each have a memorable quality for them which makes them feel more like real people; Mr White supports others frequently, Mr Pink only looks out for himself, Mr Blonde is essentially a psychopath and Mr Orange is a newcomer with not much experience. Each cast member gives a great performance, however there are some slight issues with some characters that I'll get onto later.\n\nThe film's story is told in a non-linear structure, with the present section of the film taking place entirely within a warehouse. Each character recounts what happened to them and we are shown parts of their backstory leading up to the robbery, as well as a few things that occurred afterwards. The intelligent thing that the film does is never actual show the heist itself as even though by the end of the film most things would be solved, it leaves some mystery still lingering there and makes the film more intriguing throughout rather than just simply showing stuff.\n\nIt is clear throughout that Tarantino is a huge fan of classic songs and films, and the inclusions of these references don't overstuff the film in any way and instead makes it more unique and stylish than your average crime film at the time. Music is also cleverly used ironically throughout the film too, as in one scene a man is being tortured in a very brutal manner but due to the happy song playing in the scene it makes you relax and enjoy it, until the moment when the music goes off and you realise what really just happened.\n\nSo the setup for the film is absolutely brilliant and it is thoroughly entertaining throughout, however when I look back at the film I realised that not really much happens in it; there's the criminals arguing about what happened, them going to do their business and then the rat is revealed. While I liked the reveal, I found it to happen very out of the blue and I personally thought it would have been much more interesting if the criminals had to piece things like clues together themselves to work out the truth, and due to them each likely having a different perspective it would cause a conflict between them (which is what the film makes). What we received wasn't bad or lazy, I was just hoping for something more intriguing.\n\nI also felt there were a few unnecessary elements to the film. There was one particular character who was rather pointless and he literally has no character in the film, even the poster and the tagline of the film forgot he existed. The fact that he is rather unknown creates a suspicion throughout that he may be the mole, however after we find out that he isn't the mole it makes his character pointless in the end. There is another character in the film who pretty much has the same sort of role as the other one (a McGuffin), but what was different about this character was that he was an amusing person and had some sort of character to him, and it's also clear that the film is aware of his part in the film as in the very first scene he is subtly set up as a non-important character.\n\nAnother thing I felt which may have just been me was I thought that the backstory for Mr Orange went on for a bit too long, as it sets up both his character and also the start of the robbery because of his character being the last one whose backstory is shown. These two parts are shown without any cuts in between which felt a bit overlong to me (the film doesn't feel overlong in total length though). However, I may be the only one with that gripe like I said.\n\nAs I ended the review with my criticisms, it may sound like I gave the film a mediocre review but overall, I thought that this film was great and the issues I pointed out weren't major but things I felt could've been done slightly better. I had a blast watching the film and I would happily rewatch it any time; it has great performances from the cast, an interesting and intriguing storyline, lots of style and a very entertaining film throughout, however there were one or two things I would change if I was the one who had made the film.\n\n8.3/10"

            "review": "This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isn't a simple, cut-n-dried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant' part of his life - the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.David `Noodles' Aaronson (DeNiro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. That's the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isn't a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.DeNiro's portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles' own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway -- the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination."

Story-wise it wasn't bad either and there were some good moments, but then I remember the thing that slightly spoiled it for me and that was the length. This movie comes in many versions. I saw the 3 hour and 49 minute long version. I have not seen a longer mafia movie and you could feel it. Towards the end, I was slowly losing interest and it was just getting too long for me. To sum up my feelings. I liked the film. It did. But it wasn't the best mafia movie for me, and I've seen better. This one had its moments, but they didn't quite make up for the length of the film, which was really long. So, in short. Great movie, but too long and I liked other mafia movies better, although this movie was great for me. I can recommend it to fans of the crime genre, but be prepared for a long slog with a slow pace. It's not for everyone."

The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.\n\nSergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two **** scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.\n\nThe acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Set during the 20s, 30s and 60s, it looks far too much like a 1980s film, which it is.\n\nThe score (composed by Ennio Morricone, who is a genius) belongs in a romance film, not a misogynistic gangster film where the men routinely assault and objectify women. It also has a very 1980s sounding version of \"Yesterday\", which is laughable.\n\nThe characters are unsympathetic and unremarkable, giving you no reason to root for Robert De Niro's character as he returns to his old neighbourhood for revenge.\n\nEasily the worst film of Sergio Leone's catalogue."

The plot has been discussed in other reviews already. so I won't recap it again. Basically, the movie highlights the damage that ignorance, unfounded assumptions, and the resulting hysteria can do. As I write this in the time of the COVID, we are currently witnessing how entire societies can be brought to their knees when ignorance and hysteria override logic and common sense.\nThe movie shows that at their core, humans as a whole are still very primitive, operating not on logic and reason, but on fear, hysteria, and pack mentality. The whole hunting theme that runs through the movie serves as a metaphor for this.\nEven when the lead character does finally get his life back on track after having it destroyed by hysterical fools, including his so-called friends, the ending proves that these primitive emotions and behaviors are still ever-present. Until we evolve as a species, this will continue to be the case, and many good people will continue to pay the ultimate price as a result."

All the children actors are very well cast and serve their roles well. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a man who has been beaten into submission by society regarding his marriage, his child, and now his job. Lucas is being forced to give in and give up on the things he loves and enjoys and is ostracized by those who used to be his closest friends. The Hunt is a character study detailing how desperation and innocence can combine to form apparent guilt. The Hunt is shot in such a way that we feel the stigmas of the town and feel how despicable of a person Lucas seems to be, all while knowing that it isn\u2019t true. We are led to believe that friendships are as strong as limp fetters and quickly turn to backstabs. Ultimately, The Hunt shows that the fundamentally flawed credibility of a system wherein guilt is implied and fake news is a given."

From the baseless accusation to the brainwashed belief of clearly unfounded lies to the way he is treated in the aftermath is just so aggravating. In this way, the film is brilliant. I had to pause many a time to just try and collect myself a bit and not punch my computer screen. Mads Mikkelsen is absolutely stunning in this film and turns in a terrifically believable and authentic performance as the accused teacher. The film does a great job portraying the hysteria that surrounds an accusation of this magnitude and the resulting anger and confusion. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking at times and the direction from Thomas Vinterberg is fantastic. Overall, The Hunt is a great film that may move slow at times, but really **** you in and makes you feel something for the protagonist as you watch this injustice take place."

Fourteen years later, Vinterberg returns with \"The Hunt,\" which shares many similarities with its celebrated predecessor, and it has received high praise at both the Cannes and London film festivals. \"The Hunt,\" a Palme d'Or nominee, revisits familiar ground, where Vinterberg continues to fan the flames of social unrest in a far more conventional manner.\r\n\r\nLucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher in a small, hunting village in Denmark, who is recovering from a painful divorce and working to receive greater custody of his teenage son. He is best friends with the couple that lives next door, Theo and Agnes (Larsen and Hassing), and has a fond relationship with their daughter Klara (Wedderkopp), who is also one of his young pupils. One day, the young girl says some odd things which imply that Lucas is a sexual predator. Suddenly, the town closes ranks against him, and everyone assumes that children don't lie about such things. Klara, though she tries, is unable to take back her words.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a childlike act of revenge orchestrated by a little girl who doesn't know any better, and who is trying to avoid further embarrassment or torment. However, the narrative of the story is driven by the adults of this small town. Quickly shunned by a community that once welcomed him, Lucas is left to absorb the nightmare alone, finding even his closest companions unsure of his innocence.\r\n\r\nVinterberg maintains a human focus to the story, emphasizing strained relationships and universal suspicion, while capturing the essence of despair as the characters struggle to make sense out of a confusing and volatile situation. \"The Hunt\u201d is unsettling and enraging to watch because of Lindholm\u2019s forceful script and the incredibly vivid performances, most notably Mikkelsen\u2019s sensational performance as the condemned man. The film's premise isn't anything particularly new, however, Mikkelsen's powerful performance creates a strong sense of empathy for Lucas which transcends this engrossing nightmare, where simply surviving doesn't mean your days as a target are over."

Otherwise that part was not handled right, meaning inaccurate script.\r\nAfter that I thought everything was realistic & believable & very well done.

Woody and Buzz\u2019s dynamic was never as entertaining again as it was here, and as great as the sequels are it\u2019s the one thing they all unfortunately lack.

The animation may look dated compared to CGI films nowadays, but that doesn\u2019t matter. The story is very well written and the concept of toys who come to life when their owner is not around was done perfectly. There were many great characters, of course the best ones being Woody and Buzz Lightyear. They were casted well too especially Tom Hanks as Woody. The relationship between Woody and Buzz shows great character development, with them being rivals at first but then later they become friends. The film is great for people of all ages, with many parts that everyone including the adults can have a good laugh at. This film is so good that John Lasseter won a special achievement award at the Oscars. It is an instant classic and should be considered one of the biggest movies of all time."

I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

The three most popular ones were of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Mr Incredible. In my review of The Incredibles I mentioned how I hated The Incredibles until I watched it myself, since I came from a conservative family which didn't allow me to watch foreign films. I finally watched Toy Story when I was 15 years old, and this was so awesome! Later I got to know that it was the first ever 3D animated movie, and since then my respect for it has increased exponentially.\nToy Story is a story about Woody, a toy cowboy who was his master, Andy's favourite toy. Andy was absolutely obsessed with Woody, until Buzz Lightyear came over and completely took over his love. Not just Andy but even the other toys started getting more interested in Buzz. As a result Woody became jealous and decided to settle the score. Things don't go the right way when Woody also ends up getting thrown out along with Buzz, and then they both have to team up to get back to Andy.\nThe thing that really strikes me about Toy Story is that it had a huge risk to carry. Since it was going to be the first ever 3D animated feature film, it was supposed to give an example for the other films to follow. There are many examples of how the first film **** makes the genre successful and when it doesn't happen (Superman, Super Mario Bros, Alam Ara etc). In this case Andrew Stanton and Joss Whedon did a great job in making a mark by writing the story that is one of the most iconic of all time.\nThe animation is also pretty good. The first game isn't even close to what gaming is now, the first science fiction movie is nothing in front of science fiction movies now. But the first 3D animated movie is easily something that can give a competition to what they make nowadays. The ADR, the cinematography, the story, the comic timings and even the message that the movie gave - everything about this movie is so good. This is the reason why today Toy Story is one of the most iconic franchises of all time. My favourite character in the movie was RC. He was the only one who didn't misjudge anyone. He helped Woody and Buzz come back home together. Even watching his remote control was fun; it had a steering wheel! As a kid I was never allowed to play with remote controlled cars, so just seeing such an advanced car being driven was enough to get my attention.\nI'm lucky to have been alive at a time when Toy Story was a phenomenon. It was an absolute perfection of a movie. It's kind of surprising that Joss Whedon, the same guy who made this masterpiece, later went on to make the 2017 Justice League. I hope this movie stays alive in the future and we get to see what all things can be added in the future movies because, let's get real, this franchise isn't gonna die anytime soon."

If Woody was in anyway unrelatable or unredeemable, PIXAR would not be the successful studio we have today.  The music is also very good in this movie; Randy Newman did a fabulous job with the score and songs.  Personally, Randy Newman is my favorite PIXAR composer.  Overall, Toy Story is a great movie that also happened to be a ground-breaking movie for the animation industry."

Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.\n\nDirected by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \u0096 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \u0096 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.\n\nThe \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.\n\nSure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *id\u00e9e fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.\n\nBuzz \u0096 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie's greatness.\n\nAt least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system"

            "review": "I first saw this film on its release, aged 13, and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings, even from others (whom I envy, for I can't see it with fresh eyes) who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers, for whom a forty-three year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing (and for whom punctuation, paragraphing and grammar are a lost art), I suggest they learn a little about the history of film-making (from which it may become apparent that much of today's fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s: try Eisenstein's October, for example).From the universally admired cinematography of Freddie Young, the long shot of Omar Sharif's floating mirage entry, the pre-CGI battles and pan-up scene changes, to O'Toole's florid but career-defining performance and the (then) novel time-shift narrative, this film set standards not matched even by Lean himself, and, as many reviewers have commented, financially and practically unlikely to be attempted today. I too have rarely seen such clarity of image outside of Imax, and in my view the script by Robert Bolt (and I now have learnt, an uncredited Michael Wilson) is the finest in cinema. Maurice Jarre's music and some of the acting style now seem a little excessive, but repeated viewing (around 35 times in my case) does not diminish the impact and quality, and the restoration and now DVD release still, after all these years, approaches the effect of that first 1962 viewing.It is rare that repeated watching of a film (as opposed to a live performance) does this, and the reasons go beyond the photography, performances and editing. In my opinion, it is because the characterisation and storytelling encourage an appreciation of the ambiguity and inconsistency behind our motives and behaviour, and, in a wartime scenario, in the contrast between political expedience and personal morality. For a 13-year old, this opened a window into the adult world, and it explains why the story has resonance far beyond its setting. The film doesn't require an understanding of middle-east politics (though it does have some very current relevance), but it does require an ability to look, listen and understand. The fact that so many people rate it so highly says everything about its wider impact. When The Matrix and even Lord of the Rings have slipped out of the ratings (and the adolescents who inhabit these pages have grown up), I believe this film will still be in the 20s or 30s, perhaps enabling young people to once again see the world through adult eyes.Like Ali, I fear Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us, to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more, discover something new. When I was 13 I didn't understand much, but this film helped me to see that I wanted more, knew more, than my peers. I can't rate it more highly than that."

Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, \"went native\" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.\n\nLawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction, attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn.\n\nScripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. One of the best films ever made."

From its very beginning, I was quite surprised by the amount of humor I found, not only because I didn't expect so, but also because it often works pretty well!\n\nAnother great surprise I had watching this movie is that I didn't find it boring at all despite its nearly four-hours runtime. A long runtime alone doesn't make a movie bad or weak, but it certainly doesn't help. But I really think there is almost no second that David Lean has wasted in this textbook example of epic cinema. It's quite entertaining for plenty of reasons; two of them are the fascinating cinematography that treated my eyes with some of the most jaw-dropping images I've ever seen been captured on film, and the mind-bogglingly masterful editing that is easily also one of the best I've ever seen in film.\n\nLawrence of Arabia is also surprisingly very simple despite its fiendishly complex portrait of the titular character. Actually it may be sometimes too simple for its own good, for I think the movie became superficial and shallow at the beginning of its second half for the sake of nothing but developing the character of Lawrence. There are some key events that should have been more focused on, but ended up being demonstrated comparatively quite fast and superficially. That made the second half a bit muddled, unlike the unbelievably perfect first half, but this wasn't much of an issue for me; because David Lean really make up for this simplicity by delivering a disturbing, terrifying, opulent, astute and utterly unique psychological profile of a heroic, yet flawed historical figure that is the protagonist, Lawrence. As for Peter O'Toole's performance, the only thing I could say is that I was quite mad for about the first half of the movie because how inaccurately serious-looking he appeared on the poster of the movie despite the fact he was rather good-natured, and looked quite charming. Of course, I realized that I was embarrassingly wrong when O'Toole gradually changed 100 percent to a very serious, and even seemingly mad man who struggles to find a balance in his life,nay, to discover his identity.\n\nI also want to say that I'm so so proud of Omar Sharif, who brought one of the most iconic secondary characters in the history of cinema! Alec Guinness was also terrific as Prince Faisal, although I still think he delivered his best performance in The Bridge on the River Kwai, another epic from Lean. Auda Abu Tayi is one of the most blatantly greedy characters I've seen in film, and it could have never been portrayed so convincingly by other than the great actor, Anthony Quinn.\n\nIf there is only one film deserves to be described as Epic, it's Lawrence of Arabia!\n\n(9/10)"

A curious and highly intelligent man, joined the British Army during First World War and had a decisive role in the Arab Revolt of 1916 against the Turks. Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif.\n\nT. E. Lawrence is one of the most interesting characters of the First World War. It wasn't a brilliant general or military, but got a huge part along the Arab tribes, disunited and often rivals, making them a highly effective troop (despite being composed of irregular militias). The film shows us how he got it and the price he paid (the scenes of violence when he was imprisoned by the Turks, although softened, can still suggest the alleged anal **** that he have suffered, among other tortures).\n\nThe film is full of stunning scenes of the desert and is visually appealing, perhaps one of the epic films that gave greater attention to the use of natural landscapes to impress the public. The harshness of living conditions (or rather, survival) of the local tribes is also depicted with objectivity, as well as the importance given to water and control of wells. The action scenes were well thought out and show how the struggle was unequal, apparently doomed to failure (the Arabs battled with archaic methods and weapons, when compared to those used by Turks).\n\nThe performance of the actors is something exceptional. The film is full of great players who have been at their best. Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif stand out naturally by the exceptional quality of their work, in a film that has become largely responsible for their consecration. The costumes are also excellent and, at least to me, seem consistent with the kind of clothes and uniforms depicted in photographs of the time, a sign **** historical consulting work. The same can be said of military equipment shown. The soundtrack, an essential part **** epic, is one of the best that has been done by Hollywood, having the signature of Maurice Jarre."

In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it\u2019s use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.\r\nWhen one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.\r\nSet against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.\r\nAt almost four hours it\u2019s hard to imagine a film that wouldn\u2019t feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.\r\nThe film deals with age old themes such as the \u201cfish out of water\u201d theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the arab culture, Water is so precious it\u2019s worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.\r\nUtilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it\u2019s masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience."

The film is very much accurate following the Brits and Arabs fighting against the Turks in the early 20th century. Very well portrayed and executed, the film has everything you would expect from a historical movie, being entertaining to watch every minute.\r\n\r\nThe film starts out with one of the most beautiful musical scores ever composed. We are introduced to the movie hearing an original musical score for six minutes until the movie fully begins. The score is epic, funny, and enjoyable as you wait for the movie to begin. We then see a man riding on a motorcycle, he is not in the desert, but in England. The scene then transitions to a historical sight in another part of England remembering the battle of Arabia.\r\n\r\nT.E Lawrence sets out to find the prince (played by Alec Guinness) to help him fight the Turks during the World War I era in the early 20th century. He is set out by the Brits to go and find him, many new characters are introduced along the way, such as Sharif Ali (played by Omar Sharif), and Auda Abu (played by Anthony Quinn). The best thing about the characters, they all have something to do with the plot, not just to be thrown in there to be extras.\r\n\r\nThe setting is like no other, taken place in the Arabian desert, the setting makes the adaptation of the film unique. The award winning cinematography made the film as great as it is and beautiful to look at. The costumes fit with the story of the film as all the Arabs look like the way they the used to look like.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Lawremce of Arabia\" is a classic masterpiece. The film truly deserved the best picture award, and without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. There is no other film I have seen that could top this one. Simply memorable by all the performances and classic scenes, this one os worth a go."

                    "review": "The historical epic has been a staple of the motion picture industry since the silent era. Over the years, it has evolved to mesh with the times and meet audiences' expectations. Viewers in the 1910s got D.W. Griffith's racist Birth of a Nation, while movie-goers in the 2000s were poleaxed by the trite but visually impressive Pearl Harbor. In between lie the best of the epics, and, while it's impossible to single out one as being at the inarguable top of the heap, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is certainly a contender for the position. Riveting from beginning to end, featuring stellar performances, amazing cinematography, and a story without a trace of fat, the film does everything an epic is supposed to do - and more.\r\n\r\nLawrence of Arabia recounts the larger-than-life exploits of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), an officer in the British army serving in the Middle East during World War I, who, according to one observer, \"was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey.\" The film opens in 1935, with a prologue that shows Lawrence's death as a result of a motorcycle accident, followed by his funeral. The time frame then shifts back more than 20 years to Cairo, where Lawrence is about to begin the greatest adventure of his career. His commanding officer orders him to enter the desert and make contact with the Bedouin Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness), who is a British ally in the fight against the Turks. What follows is not only an account of how Lawrence became a pivotal figure in the Arab revolt against the Turks, but of the nearly-Shakespearean rise and fall of his character.\r\n\r\nThe director's cut runs a little over 3 1/2 hours, and every moment seems necessary. The pacing is tight - there's plenty of action and adventure interspersed with character development, plot exposition, and majestic visuals. Therefore, it's hard to believe that a theatrical version exists in which more than 30 minutes of material was excised. Indeed, most people who saw this film during the 1960s and 1970s weren't getting the entire picture (although Lean was involved in the trimming done to create the 3 1/4 hour print widely seen in U.S. theaters and the 3-hour version shown on television). Fortunately, in the late-80s, the original edition of Lawrence of Arabia was painstakingly restored (with the participation of David Lean and the surviving actors). The restoration was handled so expertly that, watching the new print, it's virtually impossible to see the shifts in visual acuity that often mark the inclusion of previously-eliminated scenes.\r\n\r\nThe most compelling aspect of Lawrence of Arabia is the way in which it dissects the fluid, often-contradictory personality of the title character. Like many of the best classic \"war\" movies (such as Patton), this one uses the battles as a backdrop for a character study. The combat sequences in Lawrence of Arabia are perfunctory, with few of the details shown. This allows us to focus on the individual at the epicenter of the storm. When we first meet him, Lawrence is an oddball craving a mission in the desert (calling it \"fun\"), something that his fellows shun. After spending some time with the Arabs and being asked why he likes the desert, he has a simple answer: \"It's clean\". The movie explores Lawrence's friendship with Sherif Ali, and shows how the Arabs willingly adopt him as their leader, even though he has white skin. But Lawrence's psyche suffers a severe blow after his torture at the hands of the Turks. Initially, he is unwilling to return to the desert, but, when commanded to do so, he comes back driven by a newfound lust for killing and a desire for revenge. His final mission - the capture of Damascus - shows Lawrence's dark side.\r\n\r\nThere is one visual oddity associated with the manner in which Lawrence of Arabia was filmed. Because it was not possible to shoot the night scenes at night, they were lensed during the day using light-damping filters. So, while it looks like night, the camels and horses cast noticeable shadows. Today, computers would be used to digitally erase these anomalies (then again, today, the filming could be done after dark), but their existence in Lawrence of Arabia adds a certain otherworldliness to those scenes in which the \"night-shadows\" appear.\r\n\r\nFor David Lean, widely regarded as one of the masters of epic filmmaking, Lawrence of Arabia represented the most ambitious undertaking of a fruitful career. Restored to its full length in 1989, the version available today shows the story as Lean intended it to be seen - provided the viewer is able to see it projected, not compressed onto a TV screen. While it's true that Lawrence of Arabia still works on the small screen, it is robbed of one of the most important aspect of any motion picture spectacle - the awe factor. When that is present, this becomes an event - something that even the most restless viewer will become lost in."

Lawrence in his debut is no menial task, but captured through his calm and collective speech, his arrogance for command and his undying will to succeed where most believed impossible is achieved impeccably on numerous occasions from O'Toole.\r\nLawrence, a British Army Lieutenant and very much out of place in his position, is assigned to assess the intentions of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his struggle against the Turks. Upon eventually meeting the Prince, Lawrence's constant interruptions of his General intrigues the Prince, who then lets Lawrence carry out his own mission of a sneak attack on Aqaba, a Turk-fortified city.\r\nAs Lawrence earns the respect amongst his combatants, he soon finds himself as a sort of God amongst men, they would kill for him and also die for him.\r\nThe score from start to finish immediately solidifies what this film is doing, creating and building an epic story, character driven and thoughtful masterpiece to cement a legacy not only for the man it follows, but for its own reputation as a film, and a film it is. A more beautiful and stunning film is rare to see without countless special effects, yet Lawrence of Arabia uses something that is seen as nothing, the desert, and completely obliterates any of the concerned.\r\nWhen films like this are viewed on an imaginative and respected level, its difficult not feel very different than you were before watching them, much like Apocalypse Now and others, Lawrence of Arabia gives you something that you may not have ever witnessed before, and probably won't witness again, the effort of the film, the stunning visuals and the literary brilliance of the writing, especially for the wonderful Peter O'Toole, along with Omar Sharif, many moments of screen time are given to O'Toole, and with his piercing blue eyes its hard to look away for whatever reason.\r\nTake it from a fan, you will never see another film quite like this, best films lists or not, this is what a masterful film is all about, big and bold on every scale, never holding back its potential and delivering a powerhouse feature that lives on fifty years later, you owe it as a film fan to watch and be amazed."

I watched this because it was voted top Adventure movie in many places, but I would not call this an adventure, more a biography as stated before. There is no structure to make this an interesting and exciting story, just a historical retelling with only its events as pacing, making it slow and unsuspenseful.\nIt certainly didn't need the extra hour and a half it took, but lacking any structure they decided to show everything they had and cut nothing.\n\nOverall I liked the movie despite the score, but it certainly is no adventure movie or anything worth 3 and a half hours unless you're into movies like the ten commandments.

It was in the top 10 of the AFI top 100 movies of all time, and it had received many 4 star reviews. About an hour into the film, I fell asleep. Now, fans of the film would say, \"Oh, you can't handle the impact of a long epic film. You have a short attention span.\" Well, with me, that is not the case. But, on the subject of length, this film is almost four hours long. For the content displayed in this film, the running time was way too long. If Titanic can cram all the hefty things it needed in a matter of 3 hours, then this is no excuse. Nothing was happening. I mean, literally nothing. The screenplay needs a real doctor, because it has so much unneeded dialogue. It just procrastinated its way through, I think because it really had nothing more interesting. Director David lean is probably one of the best directors of all time, but in this film, you can tell that his and the producer's mind frame was \"I wonder how many academy awards I can get through this film?\" It wasn't made naturally, it was gargantuan for this point. I about turned off the movie when I saw a thirty second look at the desert landscape for about the millionth time. Yes, it does take place in the desert, but this movie was called \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" not \"The Arabian Desert.\" Which brings me to my next point: Peter O' Toole. I have seen him in many marvelous performances. I'm surprised he hasn't received an Oscar yet. But, his interpretation of Lawrence was so vague. You only saw the exterior, you never saw the interior. He gets a rush out of killing, yet we don't know why. i partially blame it on the script writers, but I also partially blame it on him. When you are an actor, you have to convey to the audience who you are, no matter how good or bad the script is. he is playing the character that embodies the whole movie. It is solely about him, and he doesn't sell that. Now, I'm not going to bash everything just because I don't like the film, but i will compliment Alec Guinness for his outstanding but short performance as Prince Feisal, Maurice Jarre for the superb score, and the editing.  Sorry to burst the bubble of the \"Lawrence of Arabia\" fans, but I really think this film is overrated, and that it is not as good as it is made out to be. That is my opinion on \"Lawrence of Arabia.\""

            "review": "Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!"

                    "review": "Few films, animated or otherwise, manage to capture or communicate the painful and false dichotomy of humanity as something apart from and opposed to Nature itself as compassionately as Miyazaki\u2019s, Princess Mononoke. This agonizing conflict between Creation and the created is made all the more poignant by the shifting perspectives of good and evil. Gods, animals, plants, humans, spirits and demons\u2014 all are struggling to find their way as their relationships are strained by the encroachment of human greed and the accompanying callousness; almost all become victims of their disparate agendas.\n\nAnd let it be said, Princess Mononoke is indeed a film, as to call it a movie does injustice to the scope of storytelling and philosophical brilliance Miyazaki brings to the screen. That said, do watch the original subtitled Japanese release too, as some of the deeper meaning is watered down in the dubbed English version. I cannot say that any of the Western voice actors did an exemplary job\u2014 but thankfully Billy Crudup managed to bring a sincerity and earnestness to Prince **** that absolutely fits the character perfectly. Claire Danes is the weakest link, as the gravity of a few crucial moments is lost in her uneven and at times mechanical performance. It is distracting, but does not detract from the overall impact of the film.\n\nSet in a far more believable realm than most of Miyazaki\u2019s other films, many of which tend to touch upon the magical and the mystical, the impact of the conflict between \u201cancient\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d, the spiritual and the secular, is heightened by the story\u2019s true protagonist, a seeker in the form of Prince ****. His role is unusual in that he is an embodiment of neutrality, non-aggression, and active altruism. He is not a conventional protagonist. He does not possess answers, or a vision, or even a distinct goal, other than bringing peace to others. It is the pureness of his being that emphasizes the relative nature of good and evil as seen through the eyes of each character, providing a steady moral compass for the viewer to check their own passions against.\n\nHe is a person outside of time, with values from another world, a world he must abandon in order to meet his destiny. Conflict is brought upon him, and so he must seek out its source. It is clear that it has always been his agenda to preserve peace, for himself and others, but he is now stricken with a curse that will require all of his goodness to overcome. It is his \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d upon which all of the drama unfolds.\n.\nThere is no shortage of epic action and sweeping moments of grandeur to go along with humorous, mundane interactions. Needless to say, the animation is mostly stunning, especially during the action sequences and in the expressiveness of the characters\u2019 faces, in general. And being a Miyazaki film, of course whimsical touches abound\u2014 but there is a realness and grittiness that reminds the viewer this is a real world, with high stakes that affect every character, and lawful consequences that might cause a cascade of salvation or devastation, depending on which way the wind blows. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a wasted line of dialogue or a careless frame of art in the entire film\u2014 every moment is purposeful, which is most palpable when Miyazaki\u2019s representation of the Spirit of the Forest makes an appearance. It is impossible to not feel the reverence captured in this animated embodiment of the Ineffable.\n\nWithout giving too much of the plot away, there is the constant sense of inevitability building up throughout the film, a creeping doom that culminates in an ending that feels too appropriate to actually be satisfying. Maybe you\u2019ll feel the same way; maybe not. Miyazaki does not cop out, and you will be challenged from start to finish, questioning your allegiances within the movie, and in the real world, even after the ending credits begin to roll."

I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Actually it was also my first Ghibli movie and I just watched it with a friend because he recommend it. It was an amazing experience as it had a great story with depth, characters that are well written, of cause the Studio Ghibli animations and an awesome soundtrack that I see as one of the best in animation. Lets start at the beginning: Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli were amazing. They produced animated movies that are considered masterpieces back then. The track record includes a lot of the best Japanese if not worldwide made ones. Today they have a few weaker movies in the line up but no catastrophes. The story is set in an unspecified year of the Muromachi period also know as Ashikga period in Japan which lasted from 1336 to 1573. The Emishi people who are original inhabitants of Japan (Like the Ainu) struggled with the Ashikaga government and are in hiding after they were driven off. A secluded and hidden village (No not Ninjas) of the Emishi is attacked by a demon. **** who is the last of heir of their rulers manages to kill him after a peaceful solution was not possible. With his last strength the demon wounded Ashikaga\u2019s arm and cursed him. The curse will grow with time and kill him but also gives him more power at the price of fastening the process. The villages female shaman explains this to him and that the demon was originally a nature god and not a demon. He has to leave the village and could never return but may find a cure in the West were the demon came from. This is the set up of the story and the start of an epic adventure. It is an amazing story. There is so much depth and motives. Nature vs man, different world views and philosophies, heritage, conflicts and interests. You can watch it just for the story or analyze the motives, developments and actions of the characters. Then there is the atmosphere that won me over immediately. No other Ghibli movie worked this well and there is a lot of competition. The next strengths are the characters. All have believable motives, develop thorough the story and have great interactions. There is no simple good vs evil here. It has my favorite cast with ****, Lady Eboshi, San, Jigo, Moro and Hii. Also all the minor characters are good too. The depth and clear motives improve an already great movie. You always know why the characters act this way and what motivates them. The art style and animations were amazing back then as it is a staple of Ghibli movies. The soundtrack is a masterpieces and one of the best I have heard. Joe Hisaishi is a true master in his field and this has so many good tracks. The voice actors are a bit uneven depending on the chosen language. The original Japanese voice actor are amazing, the English ones are a bit weaker but definitely not garbage and the German are really good ( I am a native German speaker). Overall this is a masterpieces and one of my favorite movies. I fully recommend it and see it as timeless classic."

However, it shows both sides of the story and is left to the bias of the viewer to decide which side they're on rather than forcing you to take nature's side which is something a lot of those movies do. It has great voice acting and the animation is stunning. It is very inventive and subtle and never fails to amaze. This film is highly recommended."

Sure the movie is longer than most want it to be but the movie was paced well around it. Sure the movie could have been quicker or slower but if they did that then so many loose ends would be left. And as for those who can't understand why he doesn't return to his village. It's one of their rules once you leave you are no longer allowed to return and his \"love\" interest is his younger sister who wished him goodbye forever. Sure the arrowhead didn't have much significance to the story but why should it, in the end it was a gift for the wolf girl because he cares for her and much like his sister wanted her to be safe even if they never met again, or met as enemies.\r\n\r\nYes the movie had no villain but that's the point life doesn't have a villain that's all based on perspective the movie shows you the good of both sides so that you can see and understand that there is no villain they are simply humans trying to live and survive in the changing world. I know that the wolf girl \"loves\" the main guy (I can't remember their name). Their relationship wasn't really romantic in the slightest sure he said some things here and there but she didn't really do much beside protect and look after him according to her debts and the spirits. I think they have a deep and true admiration for one another but I personally wouldn't call it love.\r\n\r\nAside from some personal preferences here and there I loved it. I'd watch it again."

            "review": "I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.What matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn't relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it's not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don't know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it's just amazing! Even if it's the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It's a wild roller-coaster, and I'm not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There's just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I'm sure that after watching the film again I'll find out even more! There's also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it's great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.The old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It's really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.I realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there's nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it's done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.To wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!"

And tto add to that, the animation is impeccable, the story is great, and the characters are lovable (old and new). A great way to end a great movie series"

It has been a year or two since I watched it last and I was afraid I was going to think that it's another disposable kids film on my most recent viewing, but it's not.  This movie will be extremely entertaining for kids as it was for me, but it will make adults cry.  Moving on and letting go is a message anyone can relate to.  The first two-thirds of this movie is really great, but the last third is top tier film making.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Every emotion they go for hits you really really hard and all the sequences had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.  If you're a parent, show this to your kids.  If you're a grandparent, show it to your grandkids.  If you are going to college for the first time, watch it.  There's not one person that this movie wasn't intended for.  This movie is intended for everyone.  If you don't like this movie, why?  Did it make you feel too much?  Give me a break.  This is my favorite Toy Story movie, my favorite PIXAR movie, and my favorite animated movie of all time."

The animation is absolutely beautiful and the story is excellent. Toy Story 2 had one luxurious moment, but Toy Story 3 has those luxurious moments to scatter and I won't spoiler, but mainly the end is perhaps the best moment in the history of animated films ever.

It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.\n\nThe creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.\n\nThen, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.\n\nFinally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again."

                    "review": "Toy Story 3 (2010): Sweet, refreshing, and surprisingly dark, Toy Story 3 brings another great, albeit less well written installment in this series. It starts with Andy playing with his toys through the eyes of his imagination. While this scene is good and a nice homage to the first film, it fails to trump Toy Story 2's visually creative and memorable opening. Years later, after Andy puts all if his toys other than Woody into a bag in front of the attic door, the plot is set in motion when Andy's mom mistakenly thinks that the toys are trash after the attic door just happened to close on its own. This ends up being a problem with the movie: things just happen with no explanation or character involvement. There just happens to be an inside window open in the daycare, and Mrs. Potato Head's eye just happens to work when the plot needs it to. It's okay for this to happen once or twice in a movie, but when there's a kite on the center of the roof of daycare for Woody to use, it become unrealistically ideal. But, other than that, the movie is outstanding. The characters in the movie are some of the best in animation, with both Woody and Andy containing basically the same character arc throughout: learning to say goodbye. The characters are also wonderfully voice-acted. It has a beautiful score by Randy Newman that enhances every scene, especially Lotso's origin, the incinerator scene and that tear-jerking ending. But, the highlight of this film is its animation, which holds up today just as well as it did back when it was released. Overall, while the screenplay is just okay, everything else about Toy Story 3 is spectacular from beginning to end."

The film stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen, who bring to life a love triangle that supports the entire film. The script is extraordinary and doesn't deserve critical, as well as the cast performance. Kelly and Reynolds solidified their **** with this film, in all fairness, for they are amazing together and excellent when separated. Jean Hagen gives life to some of the film's most hilarious moments. As far as music and songs are concerned, they are truly beautiful and some of them are in the ear. It is not by chance that most of the songs in this film have gone to the history of cinema and have become as immortal as the movie itself."

Honestly though, I didn't enjoy this.\n\nIt's certainly worth noting musicals are probably my least favourite genre, but I'm still more than capable of finding entertainment with them - e.g. 'The Greatest Showman', 'The Sound of Music' and others.\n\n'Singin\u2019 in the Rain', however, simply didn't connect with me. There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted.\n\nNone of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to \"Singin' in the Rain\", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking. Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that's intentional with her to be fair.\n\nI will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent.

Everything is told in flashbacks: the mourners' memories unfold naturally, as people remember what the man did and struggle to comprehend why.This film I would nominate for the golden five of the century!I first saw it in 1956 or so at a small theater in downtown Chicago. A second viewing, years later, confirmed my initial pleasure!"
